<h2>3. Traffic Regulation</h2>
<p>Every business is required to drive more traffic on their websites, and that is the primary motive to build web applications so that users can use and work at their best creativity. For every business, the current situation is to drive more and more traffic because the more the traffic a web app routes, the more in a website users are there to deal with. This way, all web application hosting comes under cost-effective terms, or even sometimes, the webserver stops functioning with the loss of data.</p>

The way an application handles exceptional errors has a significant impact on a user&#8217;s reliability for a web application. So, it becomes a duty for software to work well so that whenever a user places any error in the applications, he/she must get notified for their inconvenient action.</p>
<p>Also, if a user&#8217;s action is non-reportable and becomes unacceptable even after pressing the needed buttons, it must get reached to the user in the form of an error message. Users can blame an application for not catching correct errors and exceptions. The user can move to the next website and may never decide to return to your website ever again, especially for a business person who knows how inappropriate it feels to lose honest customers and reviews from a website.</p>
