										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Running a successful fashion/beauty salon with the current cut-throat competition in the field is a definitely a difficult task. One needs to utilize all resources available for promotion and marketing in order to reach the clientele and maintain a profitable business. The best way to do this is through the web – Digital Marketing is the best and most convenient solution.</p>
<p>Taking a leaf out of their book will help your business prosper by connecting with the customers at a personal level. Here are some helpful tips for all new as well as existing beauty salon owners:</p>
<h2><b>Website</b></h2>
<p>Making a website is the first thing that you should invest in. The layout should portray the theme of your salon as well as be attractive enough to keep the interest of the website visitor. Clear tabs with information about your salon, your theme/motto and the services that are offered (you may or may not include a rate card) are essential. The website can also include a soothing background music and pictures of the staff and happy customers. Contact details and address are obviously a must!</p>
<h2><b>Social Networks</b></h2>
<p>Once your website is up and running, the next digital media sector that you should target are the social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest etc. Take a look at the existing pages of beauty salons across the nation and in your city. A fun and interactive page are what is required to be maintained. For example, regular tweets with latest fashion and beauty related topics can be uploaded to Twitter &amp; Pinterest.</p>
<h2>Use Facebook’s Potential</h2>
<p>Facebook is an excellent forum for promotion and marketing because of its multiple interactive features. Regular updates about client sessions (satisfied customers will be more than happy to pose for a picture) in the salon can be done by your employees. Professionalism needs to be maintained. Uploading pictures or videos of the latest trends in beauty, makeup, hairstyles, fashion and related areas will keep the interest of the page visitors active.</p>
<h2>Interactive Sessions</h2>
<p>Interactive sessions with your stylists can be arranged on any social media site wherein the clients can directly chat with your stylists and clear their doubts. Also, special offers or coupons can be given out especially for your Facebook fans or Twitter followers.</p>
<h2>Online Appointments</h2>
<p>The option of setting up an appointment online should be made available on all these forums.</p>
<p>Following these simple steps will definitely give your salon business a boost and enable you to reach a variety of clientele. With people checking their Facebook and Twitter almost every hour, you are bound to get the exposure that you desire and excel by providing the best customer service.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">The fashion industry is big and booming today with numerous fashion enthusiasts taking to the Internet to spread the word about their business and to attract customers.</p>
<p>If you would like your fashion business to do better than your competitors you have to do things either differently or better than them. Keep in mind that competition is fierce and over the web, you are competing at an international level. This is the reason why you should do everything in your power to excel.</p>
<p>The good news here is that even though the Internet has increased competition, it has given us easier and quicker ways to beat the competition. One such blessing is social media. Fashionistas are all over social media to promote themselves because this powerful tool can indeed spin wonders.</p>
<p>However, social media is beneficial only when you appreciate its potential and use it accordingly. We have for you a few tips that will enable you to optimize your business using social media:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4762 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-23-scaled.jpg" alt="Best Tips to Generate More Customers from Social Media For Fashion Business - infographic 23 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1920" height="1083" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-23-scaled.jpg 1915w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-23-300x169.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-23-1024x577.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-23-768x433.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-23-1536x866.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-23-2048x1155.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-23-960x541.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-23-600x338.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-23-1135x640.jpg 1135w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-23-800x451.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" title="Best Tips to Generate More Customers from Social Media For Fashion Business 7"></p>
<h2>Use Pictures</h2>
<p>In the fashion world, it is all about visuals. That is why you should establish your presence on social media platforms that are specifically for pictures. These include Pinterest and Instagram. Both these portals are all about pictures and are the best for a fashion business. Of course, you may use Facebook and Twitter but even on these portals, it is advised that you speak through pictures and limit text.</p>
<h2>Customize Your Messages</h2>
<p>It is totally unacceptable to upload the same message on all social media portals. This is because your followers on Twitter have a completely different train of thought when compared to your followers on Instagram. On Twitter, you will see people who are more into technology while Facebook is for everyone. Instagram is specifically for those who love sharing images, as is Pinterest. This is why you should segment your messages based on the platform you are using. Generic messages will not appeal to everyone.</p>
<h2>Establish A Connection</h2>
<p>On social media, direct promotion of your fashion business will not help you at all. Social media is a portal to share information and to connect first. Only then should you think of promoting yourself. Also, the promotion should be discreet. Your focus should be on establishing a connection with your audience by narrating stories about lifestyle. You may also get in touch with your customers to share their stories.</p>
<p>Most of them will be happy to do so. When you share these stories you will attract others as well. You also have the option of creating suggestive, beautiful stories of lifestyle that may appeal to your target audience.</p>
<h2>Retarget Your Visitor With Facebook Ads To Increase Conversion Rates</h2>
<p>Most people are not ready to buy immediately upon seeing an ad or visiting your website. With retargeting you’re able to reach the same people that were thinking about buying your product with reminder ads.</p>
<p>You can retarget visitors to your website by creating <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-website-custom-audiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Custom Audiences</a> with Facebook (with just a snippet of code), and target <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-website-custom-audiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lookalike Audiences</a> as well to expand your reach.</p>
<p>If they don’t purchase—let’s say after a week—you can give them a slight discount in the ad to get them to act. Retargeting people who have abandoned their shopping cart is also a fantastic way to generate sales that otherwise would have been lost.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=477687" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4223" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/58da17cf.jpg" alt="Best Tips to Generate More Customers from Social Media For Fashion Business - 58da17cf - Zera Creative" width="900" height="90" title="Best Tips to Generate More Customers from Social Media For Fashion Business 8"></a></p>
<h2>Create Style Guides</h2>
<p>Create style guides to show your visitors how to wear or incorporate your items into their everyday life.</p>
<p>If you own a fashion brand that sells a variety of clothing items, put together a style guide for your website so that visitors and subscribers can get ideas on how to wear your clothing, and even incorporate pieces into their existing wardrobe.</p>
<p>Don’t limit yourself to just one guide. Style guides can be done seasonally (spring, summer, fall, winter), for special occasions (wedding, party, picnic), holidays (Eid, Christmas, New Year’s), and for more topical themes: travel, work, weekend, beach.</p>
<p>Here is the great example of one of our client: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/closetfashionpk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Closet Fashion</a><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1456 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/closet-fashion-instagram.png" alt="Best Tips to Generate More Customers from Social Media For Fashion Business - closet fashion instagram - Zera Creative" width="890" height="522" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/closet-fashion-instagram.png 890w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/closet-fashion-instagram-300x176.png 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/closet-fashion-instagram-768x450.png 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/closet-fashion-instagram-600x352.png 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/closet-fashion-instagram-800x469.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px" title="Best Tips to Generate More Customers from Social Media For Fashion Business 9"></p>
<p>Guides can be listed as a special section on your website and incorporated into your blog or Instagram, where you can provide more in-depth information on each item in the collection. Try telling a story with the style guide to interest your customer.</p>
<h2>Work With Influencers</h2>
<p>Yes, work with influencers in your category to provide you with access to a new audience, gain social proof, and receive unique content.</p>
<p>To get in front of your ideal audience, work with a popular fashion vlogger or blogger that already has a dedicated following of people who would like your brand. Those with large audiences have built a reputation and are well respected by their readers. They can have a huge impact if they choose to mention, review, or even wear your products. <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7222" src="https://uhurunetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fashion-Digital-Marketing-to-increase-sales.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="https://uhurunetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fashion-Digital-Marketing-to-increase-sales.jpg 300w, https://uhurunetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fashion-Digital-Marketing-to-increase-sales-150x150.jpg 150w, https://uhurunetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fashion-Digital-Marketing-to-increase-sales-299x300.jpg 299w" alt="Fashion Digital Marketing to Increase Sales" width="300" height="301" title="Best Tips to Generate More Customers from Social Media For Fashion Business 10"></p>
<p>You can work with them to create content around a specific campaign or just create gorgeous images with your product. Their influence and creative take on your product will garner great interaction and sales.</p>
<p>Working with bloggers gives you two huge things: you get in front of a new audience and, if you selected the correct influencer, then you’ll gain new customers and the blogger will create content for you. Depending on the collaboration, they will share custom content on their blog, and social channels, and you (the brand) may also get the opportunity to use the content they produce.</p>
<p>When collaborating with a blogger, you can also run Facebook ads featuring the photos of the bloggers to send traffic their way, and in turn, get your product(s) noticed. (Make sure you get a signed agreement before posting images of them and/or their logo.)</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PRO TIP</strong>: When working with bloggers, provide a brand guide so you give them more guidance and they create the content you’re looking for.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Do Not Try Too Hard</h2>
<p>The more you push, the harder you will fall. This is the mantra on social media. Do not force yourself on social media or push on your customers to buy from you. Keep it interactive and simple, full of colorful images that will attract your target audience. All the content, visual or textual, should be relevant, decent, and interesting.</p>
<blockquote><p>Social media is extremely powerful, especially for the fashion business. Use it to the fullest so that your business sees a boost.</p></blockquote>

<p>Over 80% companies, blog on a daily basis to get positive ROI for their inbound marketing efforts. Leading fashion brands also have been at the forefront of blogging, posting excellent social content and encouraging widespread sharing of their content.

<h2>Fashions Digital Amalgamation</h2>
<p>In the Fashion world presentation, emotion and uniqueness are the essence of the brand image created. The romance between the Fashion and Digital industries has now reached a level of maturity. Brands today are seen setting new benchmarks in social media success. If you are in the business of marketing luxury fashion brands then the content is the new black.</p>
<p>Reports from <em>eMarketers</em> suggest that the fashion industry has seen unprecedented growth in e-commerce activity in recent years with the use of new marketing technology, called digital marketing, generating huge amounts of sales. So what are the types of content that are seen working for this industry?</p>
<p>Reviews are among the top content types that have driven success for the industry. While many of these are user-generated, companies can also use content writers to create articles discussing the value of certain products. Additionally, content that discusses new trends in fashion will provide prospective clients with more information on some items.</p>
<p>Visual content is also a strong tool for businesses in the fashion industry. Prospects want to see how certain items look when included in different styles and look. Creating interesting content that discusses different styles, and which clothing suits different body types or personalities could provide a strong impetus to convert.</p>

<h2>The Approach for Independent Fashion Brands</h2>
<p>The single most important part of content marketing is making sure that is it valuable to the customer, and not focused on making the sale. Yet, this tends to be exactly where brands screw up most often and therefore the effectiveness of their efforts is lost.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why it doesn’t work out? Well, we’ll tell you why. What often happens is that the content created on the website of the brand is highly sales-oriented and does not help, educate or generate interest amongst its audience.</p>
<p>To stay away from this you must ask yourself a few basic questions:</p>
<ul class="unorder-class">
<li>What on my website will make the customer want to come back?</li>
<li>Is the information that exists on my website, only product oriented?</li>
<li>Do I offer anything to the customer that goes beyond just making an attempt to a sale?</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, if the answers to these questions are not up to satisfaction, you know it’s time for some change. Because today, with all the options that consumers have it is easier to find a designer or brand that offers something that you do not. Thus, you must create an experience for your customer when they visit your website. You must give them something beyond the product offering.</p>
<p>Content marketing is less pushy than other, more traditional methods. By engaging, educating, and/or helping your customers, you begin to gain their trust in your brand and make them feel as if you have more to offer them than just a product.</p>
<p>Nowadays, customers have started to expect your brand to have a creative content marketing strategy and if you’re not seen implementing them on your website, potential customers will start going elsewhere.</p>
<h2>Guidelines for success</h2>
<ul class="unorder-class">
<li>The first thing to keep in mind when deciding on what kind of content to create is that it must make sense for your brand. Anything that feels forced or unnatural will come across in a negative way and work against rather than for you. In Other words, don’t just create but curate matter.</li>
<li>Differentiate yourself with the content you share. Creating exclusive online products to outshine your competition is not it; you also need to generate content for that extra impact. Viral videos, lookbooks, and catwalk streaming are still strong. Celebrity endorsements are also creating an extra buzz online. Provide white background, and clean product images so that when images of your products are shared on other platforms they still look good and attractive. Consumers love to pin images of their favorite clothes or share them on Facebook with their friends.</li>
<li>Collaborate and encourage sharing of your content. Fashion bloggers now have their own community using social search tools, creating their own trends and heavily influencing a customer’s shopping decisions. Also, don’t limit yourself to just Facebook or Twitter but include Pinterest, Instagram, Polyvore, Google+, Youtube, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="unorder-class">
<li>You must spend some time thinking about your customer. What would he/she like? How does he/she spend their time? What motivates and excites her? Does he/she travel, entertain, cook, craft, or DIY? Create content that speaks to these other aspects of his/her world, beyond his/her clothing and accessory choices, and he/ she will identify your brand as the one with real value.<br />
In the sections to follow we will talk about a few such great examples who speak to the customer about more than just their products.</li>
<li>Lastly, don’t forget to measure your efforts. Things like website traffic, time spent on site, engagement with content (commenting, sharing), and actual sales as a result of this engagement are all important things to note. As you learn what works and what doesn’t and adjust what you’re doing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Few Success stories from the Fashion Industry</h2>
<p>The list below will tell us what some of the brands did and how they stood out from the rest. Also, it will throw light on the content marketing method or trend they shine out with and techniques you can follow for your startup brand or one that is already in the market.</p>
<h3><em>Victoria’s Secret</em></h3>
<p>Yes, it is a big name and yes, we all already know them, then you might be wondering why to talk about them as an example. So, let me tell you, my friends, that you just don’t make it to the top without a struggle. Also, it doesn’t take a minute for a big brand to hit the ground with bad marketing material. The secret all lies in the fact that how you choose to reach and capture your audience.</p>
<p>Much can be learned from Victoria’s Secret’s content and social approach. Their annual Fashion Shows have turned out to be a huge marketing event and generate an enormous quantity of shareable content. Using offline events to generate online content is a smart tactic to engage your audience.</p>
<p>Knowing their clientele in and out, Victoria’s Secret use customer insights to design their Fashion Show and then capture the action in a striking and glossy manner for a much larger audience on social platforms. Of course, it may be difficult to compete with Victoria’s Secret in terms of production budgets, but in your own way, it’s worth investing notable amounts of time and money into the look and feel of your content as it all comes down to visual content when it comes to market fashion products.</p>
<h3><em>Rebecca Minkoff</em></h3>
<p>Rebecca Minkoff’s RMEdit is a great example of a brand that believes in speaking to a customer about more than just her niche products. The innovative team has produced a space that, while always focusing on brand, extends past just bags and shoes, to highlight food, music, travel, arts, and culture, etc. Thus even while talking about other topics, they relate back to fashion and their own products, making it all resonate with their own tone of voice. How Brilliant!</p>
<h3><em>Net-A-Porter</em></h3>
<p>This online fashion brand takes content production to a new level, almost becoming a publisher first and retailer second. Their website and primary shop front appear like a magazine with lots of articles, features, and celebrity interviews. They then utilize their profoundly subscribed social channels to circulate their content and build a vibrant online conversation with their customers. They also showcase videos guiding clients on health issues, beauty secrets, and even yoga, making them relate to the brand even more.</p>
<p>These brands are well established in terms of Content Creators with budgets to match, but in spite of that, it’s apparent that there’s ample that other businesses, both large and small, can learn from them.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So put on your thinking hats, get creative, and dig deeper into how you can exploit content to build your brand today. Regardless of the industry, content marketing is all about connecting with your customers and discovering the basis of a conversation with them. Creating and curating content that makes customers return to you over and over again is challenging but building and getting to know your audience using strategies that work best for your brand and developing your voice is the recipe to success.</p>
