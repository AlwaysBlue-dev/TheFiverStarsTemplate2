										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is WordPress Good for Ecommerce? We might have the answer. Soon after the pandemic hits the world, the physical stores in most parts of the world shut down &#8211; due to the contagiousness of the novel COVID-19. With that, citizens across the world have started paying more heed to online selling &amp; buying and it continues to grow strong every passing day.</p>
<p>Sniffing the trend, some smart people have decided to either completely shift their business to online or add online selling into the marketing mix.</p>
<p>To function stores online and sell the items, there’s a need for a platform that hosts the store. Since you’re here reading the content, you’re planning to open an online store and are actively looking for a better option to host your store on. Since WordPress is a well-known content management system and website builder, you want to know whether WordPress is good for eCommerce websites.</p>
<p><strong>WordPress can be potent for an eCommerce website/store or can be totally fatal &#8211; depending upon the business need. For example, for a business with a few products, WordPress is the best option and for stores with a 100s product list — other options could be better. </strong></p>
<p>Is it enough to drive a decision?</p>
<p>Well, there are so many factors combined to formulate a decision, and by the end of the post you would know<br />
When you could use WordPress for <a href="/ecommerce-website-development-services-pakistan/">eCommerce </a>and when to shift to other popular eCommerce platforms like <a href="https://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopify</a> and Magento.</p>
<p>When to host a <a href="https://zeracreative.com/wordpress-development-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website on WordPress</a> and when shouldn’t.</p>
<p>Whether WordPress is secured for ecommerce websites and does it provide better security?</p>
<p>What is that <strong>one Reason</strong> where WordPress becomes a no brainer? Even if all other requirements go against the decision</p>
<p>So, without further ado, let’s dive into considerations,</p>
<h2>Consideration before choosing any host for your store</h2>
<h4>The Size of your store drives your choice</h4>
<p>The size and the products in your eCommerce store are the key factors to drive the decision.</p>
<p>Stores that are big and have a lot of products require prompt handling, which includes clear listings, sleek and intuitive navigations, and much more. Whereas, small stores with fewer products don’t need outrageous handling.</p>
<p>That says if the store is big enough, it would have more problems, especially in regard to maintenance of server and theme. Since WordPress’s WooCommerce is open-source and extremely customizable with third-party plugins and themes, it risks the potential of breaking your store.<br />
How?<br />
The plugins and theme used could have loopholes and errands for malicious coding–any abrupt changes could damage the site completely. Or routinely maintenance could waste a lot of time- which you could invest in doing something productive for your business.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there’re a lot of amazing and huge eCommerce stores based on WordPress’s WooCommerce and are running smoothly. The fact is, these stores used highly paid themes and well-coded glitch-free plugins, backed up by good web hosts. Alongside, it requires maintenance fees.</p>
<p>However, if your store doesn’t require prompt handling, and doesn&#8217;t have a tremendous number of products, you can <a href="https://zeracreative.com/ecommerce-website-development-services-pakistan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build your eCommerce store</a> on WordPress. In fact, it’s one of the best CRMs in terms of user-friendliness, posting, maintaining, and updating. And best for small to mid-sized.</p>
<p>Summing it up, stores that are huge with 100s of products are better hosted on other amazing WooCommerce alternatives (there’s a downside, discussed below). Whereas, WordPress’s WooCommerce is potent for websites that have a few products.</p>
<p>We have discussed the impact of size. And now let’s discuss an amazing Woocomerce alternative.</p>
<h2>Shopify VS WordPress Vs Magento for Ecommerce</h2>
<p>This’s one of the fierce debates. Some savvy marketers believe WordPress’s WooCommerce has more to offer, some believe Magento has amazing features for eCommerce, and some marketers vouch for Shopify, and believe Shopify has an edge over others.</p>
<p>In reality, all claims can be correct depending on your needs. Let’s compare together to elicit which one is better for your needs.</p>
<h3>Themes &amp; Plugins</h3>
<p>Shopify offers a classy set of well-designed templates. This means, that all their themes are professionally designed &#8211; even plugins come with no glitches. Whereas, the number of WordPress themes and plugins is second to none in terms of quantity. But can be hazardous to choose among the best. In simple terms, businesses with no or little technical knowledge can start a store on Shopify and pick a theme and plugins from the lot.</p>
<p>Whereas, businesses with budgets could start with WordPress + WooCommerce, providing they have the technical knowledge or have technical staff managing the store.</p>
<p>Last comes Magento, it doesn’t explicitly offer custom themes, so you’ve to rely on third-party tools for premium themes and you’ve to build ground up. So it requires prompt handling and technical knowledge to manage a site. Since it requires rigorous support, it could break your bank.</p>
<p>Based on where you’re in your business, and technical skills you can select what works best for you.</p>
<h3>Website Responsiveness</h3>
<p>All the themes and plugins on Shopify&#8217;s official website are responsive. This means, that all can adjust automatically across any device without looking botched up.</p>
<p>To select the best WordPress themes and plugins, you need to have knowledge–of which ones are responsive. Though, it’s easy to find out. Just do a google search; as you did to read this content. And you will have a lot of options before your eyes.</p>
<p>Same as WordPress, for Magento you require some knowledge about themes that would work for the kind of site you run. But because it&#8217;s a bit complex it could cost you more than the other options.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it’s always better to work with professionals like us who’ve been maintaining stores for years.</p>
<h3>Content Management</h3>
<p>Posting content on <a href="/eCommerce-website-development-services-pakistan/">eCommerce websites</a> is the best way to gain organic traction and sell more products. Providing, both Shopify and WordPress have amazing content management systems. Whereas, Magento doesn’t match the two on these premisses, rightly so; since it was developed by keeping product scalability in mind. However, you can manage content on Magneto.</p>
<p>In comparison, WordPress’s content management supersedes any other content management system by a country mile. As <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress captures</a> <strong>61.8% </strong>market share.</p>
<p>WordPress has content versioning—every single version of a pis age separately reserved/hold within a post or on a page and can replace/use or insert. Unfortunately, Shopify doesn’t have that luxury.</p>
<p>Next, WordPress allows setting different categories and tags flexibly when comparing with other options. That presents in a visually appealing and easily navigating way so anywho one lands on a website can easily navigate through.</p>
<p>For posting content—WordPress is the spearhead. But if we talk especially about product placing and management, both Shopify and Magento are intuitive and straightforward. The reason beithat ng, both are eCommerce dedicated SaaS solutions.</p>
<p>Plus, the option of <em>‘<strong>automated collections</strong>’</em> (Automated collections means you can use product titles, tags, price, etc. to create collections.) in both stores tie the competition among the two for an ultimate choice for companies with 100s of products.</p>
<h3>SEO for WordPress Vs Shopify</h3>
<p>For eCommerce business, SEO plays a huge part—essential to getting discovered organically. No business can always rely on Google Adwords or Facebook ads to generate traffic. At some point, every business wants organic traffic that sells its product.</p>
<p>Most WordPress themes and plugins are SEO-friendly and provide better optimization opportunities. However, to nail the SEO of your eCommerce stores hosted on WordPress, you need some key understanding of Meta descriptions, alt text, Product URL, page load speed, and much more.</p>
<p>Next, if you lack knowledge of SEO, then Shopify is a better option since most of the SEO functions are automated. But there’s a downside to it, you can’t create simple URL structures on Shopify.</p>
<p>Last, Magento offers optimization options for Google like it’s responsive (operating equally well across devices), user-friendly, and also feature-intensive (add as many features), but has issues with loading speed… And page speed contributes a lot to SEO.</p>
<h3>Blogging for Ecommerce</h3>
<p>We would want to discuss blogging separately from the above content management subhead because blogging is a marketing strategy to attract a lot of customers.</p>
<p>Blogging is by far one of the most tremendous ways to <a href="https://zeracreative.com/seo-company-pakistan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generate immense traffic on the website</a> and sell more products organically.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>When you create content besieging the product you sell &#8211; your customers see you as an authority and chances of organic selling increase. Because they’d believe that these guys have knowledge and authority over the subject &#8211; they’d consider buying.</p>
<p>Through blogging, we create funnels to sell products, and funnelling requires different strategies for unique products. So it’s a high-end strategy to convert prospects that land.</p>
<p>In light of the study, blogging prominence is unequivocal if you want to sell products on auto for your eCommerce business. And for this purpose, WordPress is the spearhead. It has some amazing features and supports content publishing and SEO.</p>
<p>Whereas, Shopify and Magento are super focused on product placement and automation. It’s safer to say that if selling through a blog is in your marketing mix, then WordPress can be the best option.</p>
<p>No, it didn’t say that Shopify and Magento do not support blogs and content. In fact, Magento is quite user-friendly and requires no technical knowledge to add posts. But WordPress has no substitute in this category, and it’s because WordPress is widely acknowledged as a CMS that supports blogging.</p>
<h3>Functionality Matters for Ecommerce Website</h3>
<p>Better functionality is the most preferable choice for <a href="https://www.designrush.com/agency/ecommerce/trends/ecommerce-solutions-small-businesses" target="_blank" title="eCommerce for small businesses" rel="noopener">eCommerce for small businesses</a>. WordPress, Magento, and Shopify provide better functionality. However, Shopify triumphs over WordPress in some ways. The reason is, that Shopify is an all-in solution for eCommerce stores, so it’s intuitive and easy to set up and offers everything you would need to kick-start the store and take it to the target audience.</p>
<p>About Magento, it beats both of them. Magento was developed with scalability in mind. You can have over 1000 products listed on Magento without much trouble – provided you have the correct technical support.</p>
<p>So for the functionality of huge stores – no comparison to Magento. Hands down. Next, Shopify can also be great for functionality, and you can operate it without much technical know-how. Whereas, WordPress does offer great functionality by using third-party integration tools such as WooCommerce.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, with additional lightweight plugins, you can make your store more functional.</p>
<p>The point is if you can afford to work with developers and want better, customized functionality of your store, then WordPress could be the choice. But if you don&#8217;t have a budget and are just starting out &#8211; Shopify is the answer.</p>
<h3>Security for E-commerce</h3>
<p>If your website is not secure, your business is at risk.</p>
<p>Providing that Shopify has better in-built security. It’s Shopify’s responsibility to provide you with a secure website. Once your business is set up, you’d not need to worry about cyber-attacks as Shopify has it covered for you.</p>
<p>Whereas, WordPress’s security is in your hands. It could be a negative point or a positive one. Since it’s in your hands, you can make it more secure and sturdy. But for that, you need to have knowledge about the best, glitch-free, and non-malicious code themes and plugins.</p>
<p>Besides, you’d need to keep checking on regular updates to avoid web crashing and give a smooth experience.<br />
Last, Magento is no different from WordPress. Since it&#8217;s open-source and one has to mostly rely on third-party tools. So the concern with Magento is the same as WordPress.</p>
<p>The point is, Shopify is secured to some extent; no doubt. But for WordPress and Magento you’d need to be proactive. Proactive means to keep a check on everything and anything to avoid security concerns. Alongside, you need to bout your store’s security by working with professionals like us who know how to ensure the security of a WordPress store.</p>
<p>Caveat: If you go with Shopify, you need to make sure you’d purchase templates directly from Shopify. Else, you could risk compromising website security.</p>
<h3>Does WordPress offer better integration for eCom stores?</h3>
<h3>Security for E-commerce</h3>
<p>Integration of a store with other 3rd party service providers is important to make the website function better. So it would give customers a better experience and give you (as a store owner) an advantage to customize it to your needs.</p>
<p>Shopify allows you to integrate a lot of cool tools that would make it easy to build a complete ecosystem – that handles everything from product placement to checkouts. Though Shopify is always the second guess integrating with other solutions and only allow integration when satisfied since they’re managing your website security all by themselves. This results in fewer integration options with 3rd party tools when compared with WordPress.</p>
<p>Whereas, Magento offers an enormous range of features that you could integrate with your store. 1000s of plugins and integration options are available. But, could get complicated for non-technical individuals and small store owners with moderate budgets.</p>
<p>Last, WordPress has a ton of integration options. More than enough for any business requirements. Since it doesn’t screen security, you’d need some knowledge about secure options. And with more options, you can further embellish your website</p>
<p>Better work with professionals who have knowledge about everything you need for a <a href="https://zeracreative.com/website-development-company-in-karachi-pakistan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sleek website</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>If Aesthetics is your main concern, go with WordPress all the way</h2>
<p>Have you ever purchased a product from a website that looks dull, mundane, and pale?</p>
<p>For an eCommerce store, aesthetics have remarkable weightage – without a doubt. It is right, as <a href="https://www.inc.com/logan-chierotti/harvard-professor-says-95-of-purchasing-decisions-are-subconscious.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customers buy on emotions</a> and later satisfy logic.</p>
<p>First, you have to win their heart, then prove to them the logic behind it. This’s the psychology of buying that comes in handy when making purchasing decisions.</p>
<p>This’s where WordPress chimes in and outshine. With the plethora of plugins and themes WordPress offers, you can create anything—anything means ANYTHING.</p>
<p>From the web layout to the colour combination, to the button placements, to the typography and literally everything. It gets fully customized and allows your product to stand out.</p>
<p>There’re a number of aspects that come in handy while selecting a platform to host a store. However, to sell the products and provide a seamlessly beautiful visual experience to your customers—you need WordPress + WooCommerce.<br />
There’s no better choice than this.</p>
<p>It doesn’t mean to negate Shopify or any other alternative options. All the other options offer some incredible themes and plugins and integration options. But none could get closer to WordPress due to high customization.</p>
<p>The point is, if you truly want to sell products, you need a visually appealing website that resonates with customers on so many levels. Then WordPress is the answer.</p>
<p>However, if you think aesthetics have nothing much to do with selling then you have a lot to choose from.</p>
<h2>Summing it up</h2>
<p>After a thorough study on the topic, it’s obvious that both WordPress and Shopify have benefits and drawbacks.<br />
Both are excellent choices &#8211; providing the need.</p>
<p>If you’re an up-and-coming eCommerce store owner and short on budget—you could go with Shopify. Or if you have 100s of products to lean with, Shopify is also a better choice, since it offers better automation and intuitive product placement experience.</p>
<p>And if you have a massive budget and have over 100s, or 1000s of products in your store, then you can consider Magento. The reason is, that you can get better customization over Shopify.</p>
<p>Whereas, if you have a moderate budget, not a huge list of products, and want to go all-in with marketing, aesthetics, and customization, WordPress is the ultimate choice. Not something you could consider, but a full and final option.</p>
<p>Before you leave the place, know that security is a huge concern and could sabotage your business in a matter of minutes if not catered to beforehand. So if you plan to go with WordPress, be sure you work with professionals, like us, who can handle website security, third-party tool integration, and website responsiveness.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The bottom line is, that WordPress is an ultimate choice due to its customization and Marketing benefits. Providing the technical side of things is handled by professionals like us. </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To stay relevant in today’s competitive market, most small to mid-sized businesses are on the lookout for a professional website. Because a professional WordPress website adds to the credibility of a business, which helps gain more customers and generate more gross profits.</p>
<p>But the issue arises when they’ve to decide which website builder can give a professional-looking website. Since WordPress is a famous website builder, its name tops the mind. You’re here means you also need to know, whether WordPress is good for professional websites.</p>
<p>Based on the arguments, authoritative claims, and statistics from credible resources, it’s safer to claim that websites built on WordPress are highly professional which help establishes credibility and if optimized well would attract relevant customers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Is it all to decide?</p></blockquote>
<p>Absolutely Not! There’s so much more to know before you could decide.</p>
<p>Throughout the post, you’ll see the reason why <a href="https://zeracreative.com/wordpress-development-company/">WordPress can give you a professional-looking website</a>. Besides, you’ll see what problems you could encounter with your WordPress website and what to do about it &#8211; which is indispensable to know if you want to run your business website smoothly.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s get into the nuts and bolts of analyzing the query in detail.</p>
<h3>7 Characteristics of a Professional Website;</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4751 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-16-scaled.jpg" alt="Is WordPress Good for Professional Websites? (Detailed Analysis) - infographic 16 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1920" height="1032" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-16-scaled.jpg 1920w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-16-300x161.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-16-1024x550.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-16-768x413.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-16-1536x825.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-16-2048x1100.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-16-960x516.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-16-600x322.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-16-1191x640.jpg 1191w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-16-800x430.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" title="Is WordPress Good for Professional Websites? (Detailed Analysis) 2"></p>
<h2>1. Well Designed and Functional</h2>
<p>Website aesthetics and design play a huge role to give off a professional look. It doesn’t need to go overboard and create something out of the ordinary. But the design theme, choice of colour, and meaningful graphics should be effective for the target market.</p>
<p>All these aspects are necessary to grab attention, portray a coherent message, and give a pleasant experience. Also, it adds to the vitality of conversions. Since every single graphical aspect is important for better conversions.</p>
<p>Next, a website must have a purpose that binds the overall design together, and that’s functionality. Suppose one opts in by giving their email address. Upon opting, they’re being directed to XYZ place. That XYZ place, or the following location, you direct them to should be thoroughly planned out. In other words, where do they appear next after their initial action?</p>
<p>Everything in the process must be sleek and bound with a purpose-designed functionality.</p>
<p>Does WordPress have?</p>
<p>You better believe it &#8211; WordPress offers over 3500 GPL-licensed themes. These themes are designed differently by keeping different business needs and purposes in mind. Further, WordPress is an open-source website where you can customize your website to your needs. (Caveat: That involves a bit of technical knowledge)</p>
<p>Done with design and functionality. Let’s move on to navigation.</p>
<h2>2. Smooth Navigation</h2>
<p>Smooth navigation adds to the appearance aspect that gives users a convenient experience. Advisably, the limited number of items with proper navigations in menus is better for user experience.</p>
<p>From the home page to the last page, all the breadcrumbs navigations need to be as intuitive as possible. Suppose your customer lands on the product page; it must have clear navigation to the home page and vice versa. An easy-to-use interface with intuitive navigation almost always spells out everything, which is a smart approach to increasing conversion rate.</p>
<p>With WordPress themes, simplified navigation is possible. Themes have their own preset navigations. Plus, some plugins would further help with customized navigations.</p>
<p>However, if your website is big and has a lot going on, you better require technical knowledge to further customize it.</p>
<p>Great, you have impeccable and sleek navigations, but what if your customers never get to see your website?</p>
<h2>3. Website Page Speed (Load time)</h2>
<p>A good professional website loads fast. No matter how amazing aesthetics your website has if it doesn&#8217;t load your customers would bounce off before ever experiencing it.</p>
<p>Scary, isn’t it?</p>
<p><a href="https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/how-speed-affects-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research by Hosting tribunal</a> shows the importance of 1s delay in website loading.</p>
<p>1-second delay accounts for 11% reduce page views. 16% customer satisfaction plummets by 1s site load delay. 1s delay swipes away 17% of the coveted conversion rate.</p>
<p>Have you ever thought of that? Interesting! In the bigger scheme of things, these numbers are large. 17% conversion rate just by increasing the site load speed by 1s. Crazy! Flip the script, 17% less in profits if it takes 1 extra second. Lots more to think about.</p>
<p>For every professional website we ever worked on, we make sure it loads fast. This not only adds to the professionalism but also affects overall website performance on search engines.</p>
<p>With WordPress, you can reduce site speed by using a fast-loading theme, using fewer plugins, shortening picture size that better optimize, emptying trash, reducing post revisions, drafts, and trackbacks, Enable Gzip compression, Minify and combining CSS and JavaScript, Enabling Browser caching, and install a cache plugin.</p>
<p>Here, you need to be vigilant, any rogue plug-in would reduce your website speed. Nonetheless, a perfect blend is what everyone should aim for.</p>
<p>Conceivably, you’ve checked in all those boxes still your website would remain slow.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because of your web hosting. Choosing the right hosting plan impacts a lot on site speed. This’s an important element for a professional website.</p>
<h2>4. It should be SEO Optimized</h2>
<p>If your website doesn’t show up in search results, would it make sense of anything we discuss above?</p>
<p>In today’s fast-paced internet world, it’s oddly important to optimize websites for better SERPs rankings. That requires constant testing, on-page, and Off-Page SEO optimization, Keywords Optimization, better HTML and CSS coding, Minifying JavaScripts and CSS codes, proper navigations, and much more</p>
<p>There goes a lot of technical programming knowledge to better optimize websites for search engines.</p>
<p>Every professional website is SEO optimized. The reason is, that the better the optimized website, the more relevant customers land on your website.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s suppose you want to rank for “Vegan Diet” as you are selling a vegan diet book through the blog. You craft world-class content, do all the SEO, and secure the topmost Google position. By staying on top, you’d have 750 prospects landing on your website every single month. Doesn’t it make your profit register ring?</p>
<p>With WordPress, SEO customization is easy, concerning that you know the technical side of things, and how to minify CSS and JavaScript coding, photo optimization, and a few other aspects.</p>
<p>All in all, WordPress is easily optimized. That&#8217;s why <strong>WordPress websites dominate Google SERPs by a long shot</strong>.</p>
<p>Ok! Got it. Your website is SEO optimized for the web but does it also optimize for mobile</p>
<h2>5. Mobile Optimized</h2>
<p>The searches on mobile have surged, and now every other query is being searched on a mobile or desktop. This means around <strong>50%</strong> of consumers are using mobile to search for queries.</p>
<p>That implicitly claims that if your website is not responsive and isn&#8217;t fully optimized for both laptop and mobile/tablet, chances for high profits margin would diminish, which results in an upset consumer base. Google&#8217;s study reveals 48% of mobile consumers who visit a non-friendly mobile website, would think that the company is not serious about the business.</p>
<p>That largely adds to the professionalism of a website.</p>
<p>Regarding WordPress. Yes! WordPress <a href="https://zeracreative.com/case-mobile-friendly-responsive-websites-todays-consumer/">websites can be responsive </a>and mostly are responsive. Depending upon the theme choice and plugins. Plus, some customized settings.</p>
<h2>6. Are Professional Websites Secure?</h2>
<p>In today’s internet world, security is a massive concern. Not just for giant multinational companies, but for companies of all sizes.</p>
<p>Hackers and cyber thieves are always rooting to access sensitive data and crucial information. On average, every 39 seconds, a cyber-attack took place that steals data from unsecured or mildly secured sites.</p>
<p>That’s why big-sized companies pay huge bucks to keep the hackers off.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, every professional website needs to have good web security.</p>
<p>With that, WordPress is secure as long as the developers follow the best practices… Some plugins and themes are secure; however, not all themes and plugins are secure. That could call for certain security attacks.</p>
<p>Better work with professionals like us who know how to keep your WordPress website secure. Web security is quite technical; it isn’t like you can’t make it secure &#8211; NO! You can &#8211; but it’s highly likely that a few glitches would allow spammers and stealthier to sneak through.</p>
<p>TIP: Keep your website up-to-date that way you minimize the risk of cyber-attack. <a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2019/03/hacked-website-trend-report-2018.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“As 44% hacking caused by outdated WordPress sites”</a></p>
<p>That segue to the importance of relevant content on a website…</p>
<h2>7. Relevant Content</h2>
<p>Crafting relevant content on the topic you’d want to be known for is incredibly important on any website. Especially, if it intends to sell either services or products.</p>
<p>By creating content, you win positions on Google SERPs that land traffic to your blog/website. The more relevant traffic your website gets, the better your conversion rates are. This works hand in hand with SEO. And to create and publish professional-looking content you need a Content Management System.</p>
<p>WordPress is the world-class Content Management System (CMS). <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress accounts for <strong>61.8%</strong> of the market share</a>, Followed by Joomla, which sits at <strong>4.7%</strong>. No comparison… Indeed! A clear winner.</p>
<p>Anyone with little or no knowledge can post professional-looking content on <a href="https://zeracreative.com/wordpress-development-company/">professional-looking WordPress Website</a> and can enjoy a traffic surge.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Key Statistics helping to decide whether to make a professional website on WordPress</h2>
<p>Opinions vary and can take biases. Whereas, data and statistics never lie on the face. They’re the representation of the truth, debunk myths, and put cessation on biases.</p>
<p>Let’s peek inside what story data unfolds.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://wordpress.com/about/?aff=2718" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“WORDPRESS IS POWERING 35% OF THE WEB” </a></strong></p>
<p>WordPress has been around since 2003. It was not preferable back then, but now it has come a long way, and unsurprisingly, powering 35% of the web. That shows the dominance of WordPress across the markets. From small businesses to Fortune 500s, its acknowledgement is everywhere.</p>
<p>That’s one reason why you need to have a <a href="https://zeracreative.com/wordpress-development-company/">Professional WordPress website</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://digital.com/wordpress-hosting/wordpress-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“WordPress Dominates Google SERPs with 2.28 BILLION RESULTS” </a></strong></p>
<p>Astonishing is the word for such statistics. When you hop on Google search and write WordPress you’d be surprised to see that many searches related to WordPress. Even the word *Hate* has fewer searchers than WordPress. LOL.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://w3techs.com/blog/entry/wordpress-powers-25-percent-of-all-websites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“WordPress is behind 30.3% of the top 1000 websites” </a></strong></p>
<p>Do you need to go any further after reading this? 300 out of 100 websites are on WordPress. This validates the point that WordPress is fantastic for Professional websites.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/seo-for-bloggers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“WordPress takes care of 80-90% Of Google’s Crawling issues” </a></strong></p>
<p>According to Matt Cuts, “Sites built with WordPress can rank search results because the CMS takes care of 80-90% Google’s crawling issues,”. Doesn’t that vindicate <a href="https://zeracreative.com/seo-important-key-ways-build-great-seo/">WordPress SEO friendliness</a>?</p>
<hr />
<p>Hold on before you go with WordPress for your professional website, let’s look at statistics against WordPress.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sucuri got the highest% of cleanup requests from WordPress. (90% of all websites cleaned by them in 2018)</p></blockquote>
<p>That doesn’t mean WordPress is insecure. Since its open-source, anyone can build themes and plugins which come with security vulnerabilities. Here, requires proper knowledge of this subject.</p>

<p>We can go on and on and on to add more credible names that are using WordPress. We believe these 30+ names are enough to give you a positive perspective on WordPress.</p>
<p>Our question is, are you still on the fence?</p>
<p>But, before you leave the place let’s discuss some Pros and Cons – (Based on Primary research, and years of experience)</p>
<h2>WordPress Pros</h2>
<ol>
<li>WordPress is FREE</li>
<li>Extremely customizable &#8211; From designs, features, to functionalities. Everything can be customized based on preference. It&#8217;s open-source which means you can make your own plugins, own themes, or can use third-party free or paid themes, plugins, shopping tools, and much more to make the website look better.</li>
<li>The possibilities are endless. Undoubtedly.</li>
<li>Excellent repository of world-class plugins. Other CMS solutions have not more than a few options for distinct features. But in WordPress, the choices are almost endless. Which is brilliant for a professional website.</li>
<li>WordPress is the world’s best Content Management System.</li>
<li>Great for SEO. <a href="https://zeracreative.com/best-seo-company-in-karachi/">Doing WordPress SEO</a> is easy as it’s open-source so anyone with little technical HTML and CSS knowledge can make it SEO friendly.</li>
<li>Budget Friendly &#8211; You don’t need to spend tons to create a professional-looking WordPress website.</li>
</ol>
<h2>WordPress Cons</h2>
<ol>
<li>The updates are not automatic and can break sites. Be vigilant with what theme or plugin you use. Free Plugins and Themes are more prone to crashes.</li>
<li>Since it’s the largest CMS, spammers love to spam. Unfortunately, you’ve to keep your site healthy from spammers all by yourself. Nothing automatic here, Cringy.</li>
<li>Another downside of it being a most-used CRM, a lot of hackers are always on the lookout to sneak inside and steal your data or damage your website. So, always update the software when they’re due, and keep patching plugins to the latest versions.</li>
<li>If you’re not well versed with plugins and themes better not to implement it yourself. Because it can hugely impact your page load speed. So, it’s a great concern.</li>
<li>Securing a WordPress website can be hazardous if your Programming knowledge is not good.</li>
<li>To fully customize the design to your needs, you need programming knowledge. Sometimes, you want to customize navigations, border sizing, change Typography, and many other things. Without HTML/CSS/PHP/jQuery knowledge, it would cause issues.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>In the discussion above, we’ve touched upon several factors that make up whether WordPress is a viable option for professional websites.</p>
<p>Plus, we also touched upon some factors that vouch against WordPress for a professional website.</p>
<p>Also, we saw a few hugely popular brand websites developed on WordPress.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Becoming a <a href="https://zeracreative.com/wordpress-development-company/">WordPress </a>user is the first step towards promotion of an idea, conceived by you. You may simply call it a blog, a personal page, or the platform from where you promote other people as well. In comparison to other blog hosting websites, the variety of choices offered by WordPress is immense. Yet the basic output is to put your idea on web display much in the same way as the wise words say:</p>
<blockquote><p>putting it on the paper</p></blockquote>
<p>That particular <strong>‘paper’</strong> has transformed itself into software with many interactive options. Most users enact their WordPress blog considering it to be the final representation of their idea in the world of <a href="https://zeracreative.com/web-hosting-service-in-karachi-pakistan/">web hosting</a> but many others consider it to be the first step towards the development of a website later on.</p>
<p>Many more choices can be taken up when you are finding an aim for your idea depending upon the genre of it. Here the emphasis must remain upon moving on towards better and bigger website software tools for blog development and domain hosting as well. Most users languish in the thin space between the WordPress blog and its successful promotion. This area in particular banishes most blog stories into an unsuccessful realm.</p>
<p><strong>What are the required tools to make that blog a success? </strong> The answer varies from the simplicity of available options to the adoption of better and bigger software techniques. Social media promotion can be considered to be the basis of a successful blog or website. It can be based on an entrepreneurial, food, fashion, or digital marketing idea. Social media promotion can give it the required boost.</p>
<p><a href="https://zeracreative.com/social-media-management-services-in-karachi-pakistan/"><strong>Social media promotion</strong></a> is often restricted to the friends and followers domain. This in itself might fetch a very loyal reach for your blog posts but it must not be considered an end to all means. Most WordPress users are complacent with this promotion method considering other means as hectic or costly. They ultimately come to other promotion methods but the precious time wasted could have brought more audience and followers earlier on.</p>
<p>A simple promotion method is to connect WordPress with all your social media accounts and pages. WordPress offers the feature of posting your work simultaneously on all platforms with a single button. This adds a tagline with a link to your post. It’s a simple way to show your users that your WordPress is up and running at all times.</p>
<p>You can step it up by using more interactive tools and software. Instead of just getting a link and tagline you can make posts on all <a href="https://buffer.com/library/social-media-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media platforms</a> individually with an elaborate display of the content as well. This can be done by basic imaging or post-editing software. A more elaborate way is to seek the requirements of particular social media platforms separately and design in accordance with the requirements of each platform. This would provide a certain increase in your audience with the inclusion of users, based on their distinct social media platforms.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=477687" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4223" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/58da17cf.jpg" alt="Essentials of your WordPress Blog Promotion on Social Media - 58da17cf - Zera Creative" width="900" height="90" title="Essentials of your WordPress Blog Promotion on Social Media 4"></a></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>WordPress promotion is essential and this will help you get an audience on the website that you may include in the development plan of your basic idea. It takes a few simple techniques to turn that idea into reality. The use of these tools, with a little effort, shall make you and your blog a successful enterprise.

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4727 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-07-scaled.jpg" alt="5 Benefits Of Choosing Laravel Framework for your Custom Website - infographic 07 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1920" height="1290" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-07-scaled.jpg 1607w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-07-300x202.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-07-1024x688.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-07-768x516.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-07-1536x1032.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-07-2048x1376.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-07-960x645.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-07-600x403.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-07-953x640.jpg 953w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-07-800x537.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" title="5 Benefits Of Choosing Laravel Framework for your Custom Website 6"></p>
<h2>1. The Better Option for Authentication and Authorization</h2>
<p>Working with millions of users on the website, it becomes essential to make sure that the client&#8217;s data is safe and secure. And that&#8217;s how you can maintain long term relationships with the customers. Laravel is providing an easier way to authorize users for any given resource from various sources. For authentication, there are some simple ways provided through Laravel Framework, and these are gates, via middleware, in the form of requests and policies.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Laravel framework has a complete authentication for Login, Password Recovery, and Registration system.</p>
<h2>2. MVC Architecture Of Laravel Framework</h2>
<p>Laravel is a PHP Web-Based Application Framework based largely upon MVC architecture. It was created for developers to get them started with working on PHP projects. Laravel presented a Model-view-controller architecture with the best PHP framework for developing web projects at ease. To perform built-in functionalities for developing mobile and web apps, developers came up with the MVC architectures model.</p>
<p>Besides this, MVC architecture has provided quality performance, advanced documentation, and various built-in functionalities compared to other PHP frameworks.</p>
<h2>3. Traffic Regulation</h2>
<p>Every business is required to drive more traffic on their websites, and that is the primary motive to build web applications so that users can use and work at their best creativity. For every business, the current situation is to drive more and more traffic because the more the traffic a web app routes, the more in a website users are there to deal with. This way, all web application hosting comes under cost-effective terms, or even sometimes, the webserver stops functioning with the loss of data.</p>
<p>A website will never desire to be in such a situation for their customers. Therefore, we figured out the best way to build your application projects using the Laravel framework. It will initially pop up a window with the message in the form of queues to keep your server up to date and healthy.</p>
<h2>4. A Powerful Support To Your Web Applications</h2>
<p>Web frameworks have a new and advanced feature called the Laravel framework. The framework&#8217;s popularity is high because of its advanced features, such as agility, insightfulness, cultural property, and cost-effectiveness. Also, it offers various scalable solutions for web and app-based applications.</p>
<p>Popular frameworks, such as Laravel, have a strong community that handles the security patches to secure your website. Also, with this framework, you can manage and organize data resourcefully. However, frameworks with large accountable communities are more stable with all the latest updates.</p>
<h2>5. Error and Exception Handling for website&#8217;s better performance</h2>
<p>On the internet, there are millions of websites running. It becomes challenging for software to catch errors and exceptions when the users keep on using the website. The way an application handles exceptional errors has a significant impact on a user&#8217;s reliability for a web application. So, it becomes a duty for software to work well so that whenever a user places any error in the applications, he/she must get notified for their inconvenient action.</p>
<p>Also, if a user&#8217;s action is non-reportable and becomes unacceptable even after pressing the needed buttons, it must get reached to the user in the form of an error message. Users can blame an application for not catching correct errors and exceptions. The user can move to the next website and may never decide to return to your website ever again, especially for a business person who knows how inappropriate it feels to lose honest customers and reviews from a website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last few years, marketing trends for small as well as large businesses have observed a major shift. Almost every business has put major efforts into establishing a strong online presence to accomplish the desired goals. Formerly, local businesses gained popularity by advertising through local papers or by distributing pamphlets among local people.</p>
<p>Although the competition was not as fierce as today, it took plenty of time for business owners to establish their solid presence in the competitive market. Now, if you are looking to start your new business and having an official website is not a part of your immediate plan, you may need to rethink your strategy. A search-engine-optimized website is not less than a prerequisite for businesses nowadays. All your <a href="https://zeracreative.com/social-media-management-services-in-karachi-pakistan/">marketing </a>efforts begin as soon as you accomplish this first and most vital step.</p>
<p>So, how exactly can a website take your business to a next level? Here are some of the highlighted factors that can help your business grow with much less effort applied.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=477687" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4223" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/58da17cf.jpg" alt="How a Website can Take Your Business to a Next Level - 58da17cf - Zera Creative" width="900" height="90" title="How a Website can Take Your Business to a Next Level 9"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><img class="alignnone wp-image-4754 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/infographic-17-scaled.jpg" alt="How a Website can Take Your Business to a Next Level - infographic 17 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1920" height="1032" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/infographic-17-scaled.jpg 1920w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/infographic-17-300x161.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/infographic-17-1024x550.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/infographic-17-768x413.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/infographic-17-1536x825.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/infographic-17-2048x1100.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/infographic-17-960x516.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/infographic-17-600x322.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/infographic-17-1191x640.jpg 1191w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/infographic-17-800x430.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" title="How a Website can Take Your Business to a Next Level 10"></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enhanced Online Presence</p>
<p>Having a website for your business minimizes the gap between your prospects and your services. Think of your website as the front desk of your office. Any customer that comes in will most likely arrive at the front desk and ask for what he/she is looking for. If the front desk fails to create a humble impression, your customer may not spend a lot of time and leave. Just the same way, a website makes or breaks your brand image to all your web visitors. A simple yet easy-to-navigate website can engage more users as compared to a fancy yet complicated one.</p>
<p>For example, if you are selling a product and your website displays plenty of information about your business instead of what you are selling, then your website visitors may not spend much time on your website. It is vital to display relevant information at your homepage for improved customer engagement.</p>
<h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
<p>Once you have a website, your doors to internet marketing are wide open. You can create your business profiles on <a href="https://zeracreative.com/social-media-management-services-in-karachi-pakistan/">social media</a> and integrate them with your website. Professional social sites such as LinkedIn can help you expand your network by connecting with relevant business communities (Both B2B and B2C). Facebook and Instagram are highly effective in increasing brand outreach.</p>
<p>You can use Facebook to create specialized marketing campaigns with complete control of your desired audience, demographics, and campaign objectives. You can start with a minimum budget and monitor your campaigns thoroughly. Targeting a specific audience helps to filter irrelevant web traffic and maximizes the chances of conversions.</p>
<h2>Reputation &amp; Reviews</h2>
<p>Having an online presence means that you can appear on any digital device at any time when searched by your business name or by the offered services. Business profiles on social media as well as the search engine’s local 3-pack (local business profile on Google) showcase customer reviews. These reviews help to make or break a brand’s reputation in the competitive circle.</p>
<p>Most internet users tend to choose or reject a business based on positive or negative reviews respectively. You can retain a positive reputation by asking your happy customers to write positive reviews. This way, half of your marketing efforts will eventually reduce.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While a <a href="https://zeracreative.com/website-development-company-in-karachi-pakistan/">business website</a> can help you minimize the distance between you and your clients, it also acts as a gateway to millions of internet marketing possibilities. All you need to do is take the first step by getting a market-oriented web design for your business and then you can accomplish your desired marketing goals with a minimum cost to spend.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today’s digital world, the consumer has become savvy as well as busy. They spend less and less time going through detailed websites. They are using their cell phones to access the content. The world is coming up with more and more brands, and more and more content. We all reach for our cell phones, waiting for the bus to arrive, or for food to finish warming up in the microwave. Mobile-friendly, responsive websites are key to building a brand and giving relevant content to the audience.</p>
<p>People don&#8217;t like to wait for information. Easier domain names, quicker content blocks that are easy to read, and fast-loading websites on cell phones, all help. Studies indicate that <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/metrics/2010/03/31/firefox-page-load-speed-part-i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">32% consumers would abandon a website if it is slow</a>. Studies also indicate that bounce rate can be improved by 30% if the page size is reduced, and site speed is improved.</p>
<h2>Case for Building a Responsive Website</h2>
<p>A mobile-friendly, responsive website helps your audience to check your website on various platforms and screens, from laptops and phones to tablets. The delivery of content changes but the purpose of the content does not. Do you know that there are more than <a href="https://gsmaintelligence.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four billion people</a> on this planet with cell phones? This means that a lot of your target audience lies in the realm of accessing your website through a cell phone.</p>
<p>Responsive websites mean that the structure of the website can change and adapt to the size of the screen. The user can have a better user experience in accessing your website than if it did not adapt to the type and size of the screen. The website can look good on different screens like cell phones, a tablet, or a laptop as well. Some key elements to take care of include avoiding Flash, and your text to resize instantly based on the type of screen accessing the website. To improve this user experience and to make the website responsive, all your content should be easily accessible on any device.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s search algorithms target websites that are mobile-friendly and responsive. The algorithms that came into place in 2015, give a higher ranking to websites that are responsive and mobile-friendly. For good SEO, mobile-friendly websites are preferable.</p>
<p>As a brand, having a mobile-friendly, responsive website means that you capture more users in your target niche. Any user who is not accessing your website on their computer or laptop can easily access your website on their cell phone. This means that the net of your user base can be broadened. Cutting-edge design based on modern design principles make the website appealing to the users. With strong mobile-friendliness, your website has a better brand image as well.</p>
<h2>How to Get Your Website To Be Mobile Friendly</h2>
<p>The easiest and quickest way to get a website that is mobile-friendly would be to pick up a predesigned theme from a developer or a theme foundry. You should always double-check the different versions on screens to ensure that the website shows perfectly well. If you or your developer decide on modifying the CSS, then you should ensure that responsiveness is not impacted.</p>
<p>Responsive websites need to have a few key elements that you should take care of. Responsive websites usually have a singular column, with the menu becoming more condensed for easier navigation. Colors remain the same but images are reduced to improve the speed and navigation of the website. Websites generally also have links and URLs displayed in a manner that is easy to navigate.</p>
<p>If you are not interested in a predesigned theme, you could also work on the CSS yourself, or hire a developer who has expertise in building mobile-friendly websites. Always check samples to see if the developer has experience in building websites that display well on mobile as well.</p>
<h2>Mobile Optimization Best Practices</h2>
<p>Page speed is key to mobile usage of your website. The brand-building includes several things in today&#8217;s world, and one key is having a high-speed website that is quick to load on a mobile device. Some key areas to take care of include cache, image sizes, and redirects. The cache can help load the website faster, while smaller, more optimized images and lower redirects can also boost page speed.</p>
<p>Avoid elements on your website that can impact user experience. These include Flash, pop-ups, and intricate design. If you need to show special effects, try HTML5 instead. Popups do not display well on mobile sites and are difficult to close. Complicated designs can be difficult to navigate for people with smaller screen-sized phones or fat fingers. Use CSS to develop site display options and themes so that the website can adapt itself to different screens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As people of the twenty-first century, whenever we require more information on something, our first instinct is to look it up on the internet with the help of a search engine. Chances are that almost always 4 out of 5 people will click on the website that shows up first. If one is keen on taking their website to the next level, SEO may be just the genie-in-lamp you are looking for!</p>
<p>In order to increase your website’s chances of being frequently clicked on and visited, knowing and applying the concepts of SEO or search engine optimization, is essential.</p>
<h2>So, what is SEO?</h2>
<p>It stands for Search Engine Optimization, a metaphoric rulebook for companies/website owners to follow in order to help increase their website’s ranking on any search engine.</p>
<h2>Why is it so important?</h2>
<p>In very basic terms, SEO will only benefit the website itself, making it more accessible, available, user-friendly and trustworthy.</p>
<p>Nowadays, using search engines has become second nature to us. Millions of users take the help of results offered by these engines such as Google and Bing in order to find information. School work, news reports and almost everything that is available online are found through search engines.</p>
<p>So, let us see how you can improve your website’s SEO:</p>
<h2>1. Not Another Trust-Building Exercise!</h2>
<p>SEO is significant because it helps internet users become familiar with one’s website and eventually learn to trust the results it produces. If one’s website shows up more often on the first page of results, chances are more people get to see the website, click on it and if satisfied, build a reliance on the website regarding their experience. This way the website helps gather visitors, customers, and clients with the help of SEO by building trust.</p>
<h2>2. First Search, Then Share!</h2>
<p>Build and perfect your own personal profile first. Share your business profile URLs within your own profile, populate your about section with key details of your business, and mention the kind of products and services you offer. Your personal profile should be a visual landscape of your business so that people can relate to your business easily.</p>
<p>Even if you do not portray yourself as a brand or a person behind your brand, you can still mark the products and services on your personal profile, to denote your support for them. Promote key elements of your business and your blog on your personal profile to indicate your support as well.</p>
<h2>3. First Place</h2>
<p>If more than one website is selling or promoting the same thing, websites with search engine optimization are more likely to grab the attention of customers and viewers who will see the website show up in the first few results. This way cut-throat competition between websites can be won with the help of SEO.</p>
<h2>4. Cost-Effective</h2>
<p>SEO is especially important for small-sized businesses that are looking to advertise themselves without going way over their allocated budget. It allows one to do cost-effective marketing through search engines. If you have a budget, you can always use keywords to promote your website through advertisements thus increasing your chances of visibility in the search results. This way, the SEO helps to create an online presence through the website’s frequent appearance on search engine results.</p>
<p>Just realize that a <a href="https://www.webfx.com/seo/learn/seo-friendly-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search engine optimized website</a> has twice the advantage compared to a website that is not. Therefore, choosing to apply SEO principles to one’s websites may just be the fuel required to help the company’s spaceship to skyrocket!</p>
<p><strong>Here are a few key steps in order to build a great SEO for one’s website:</strong></p>
<h3>SEO Tip #1:</h3>
<p>It’s all about the title! Make sure that every blog post/article posted on the website contains an eye-catching title that includes certain specific keywords that when searched for, show up in the first few results because they are included in the article. For SEO that is specific to a country, refer to cities and use indigenous terms that make the title of the article more relevant in order to show up first.</p>
<h3>SEO Tip #2:</h3>
<p>Along with that, use keywords frequently within the post as well, preferably in the first paragraph to build good SEO for the website. The more common terms, phrases, and keywords used that people tend to search for, the greater the foundation for fantastic search engine optimization! To do that, use keyword research tools that can help you find good keywords to use. Also, try using long-tail keywords that are longer phrases that people use to search on search engines.</p>
<h3>SEO Tip #3:</h3>
<p>Link it up! Make sure to provide users on the website, with suggestions for other articles and blog posts related to the searched article. This way it allows users to keep up to date with new and old posts that they might be interested in checking out. With interconnected links or internal link building, you have better chances of improving your website’s SEO over time. Same goes for external link building through social media submissions, publishing articles and news items that have your <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/url" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website’s URLs</a>, and directory submissions.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Overall, it can be said that building good SEO takes time but it pays off in the end. For beginners, it is a new venture into the big sea of business advances. However, good SEO may just be the best way to garner attention from internet users and eventually build clients!</p>
