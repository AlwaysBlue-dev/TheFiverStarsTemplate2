										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today’s digital world, the consumer has become savvy as well as busy. They spend less and less time going through detailed websites. They are using their cell phones to access the content. The world is coming up with more and more brands, and more and more content. We all reach for our cell phones, waiting for the bus to arrive, or for food to finish warming up in the microwave. Mobile-friendly, responsive websites are key to building a brand and giving relevant content to the audience.</p>
<p>People don&#8217;t like to wait for information. Easier domain names, quicker content blocks that are easy to read, and fast-loading websites on cell phones, all help. Studies indicate that <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/metrics/2010/03/31/firefox-page-load-speed-part-i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">32% consumers would abandon a website if it is slow</a>. Studies also indicate that bounce rate can be improved by 30% if the page size is reduced, and site speed is improved.</p>
<h2>Case for Building a Responsive Website</h2>
<p>A mobile-friendly, responsive website helps your audience to check your website on various platforms and screens, from laptops and phones to tablets. The delivery of content changes but the purpose of the content does not. Do you know that there are more than <a href="https://gsmaintelligence.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four billion people</a> on this planet with cell phones? This means that a lot of your target audience lies in the realm of accessing your website through a cell phone.</p>
<p>Responsive websites mean that the structure of the website can change and adapt to the size of the screen. The user can have a better user experience in accessing your website than if it did not adapt to the type and size of the screen. The website can look good on different screens like cell phones, a tablet, or a laptop as well. Some key elements to take care of include avoiding Flash, and your text to resize instantly based on the type of screen accessing the website. To improve this user experience and to make the website responsive, all your content should be easily accessible on any device.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s search algorithms target websites that are mobile-friendly and responsive. The algorithms that came into place in 2015, give a higher ranking to websites that are responsive and mobile-friendly. For good SEO, mobile-friendly websites are preferable.</p>
<p>As a brand, having a mobile-friendly, responsive website means that you capture more users in your target niche. Any user who is not accessing your website on their computer or laptop can easily access your website on their cell phone. This means that the net of your user base can be broadened. Cutting-edge design based on modern design principles make the website appealing to the users. With strong mobile-friendliness, your website has a better brand image as well.</p>
<h2>How to Get Your Website To Be Mobile Friendly</h2>
<p>The easiest and quickest way to get a website that is mobile-friendly would be to pick up a predesigned theme from a developer or a theme foundry. You should always double-check the different versions on screens to ensure that the website shows perfectly well. If you or your developer decide on modifying the CSS, then you should ensure that responsiveness is not impacted.</p>
<p>Responsive websites need to have a few key elements that you should take care of. Responsive websites usually have a singular column, with the menu becoming more condensed for easier navigation. Colors remain the same but images are reduced to improve the speed and navigation of the website. Websites generally also have links and URLs displayed in a manner that is easy to navigate.</p>
<p>If you are not interested in a predesigned theme, you could also work on the CSS yourself, or hire a developer who has expertise in building mobile-friendly websites. Always check samples to see if the developer has experience in building websites that display well on mobile as well.</p>
<h2>Mobile Optimization Best Practices</h2>
<p>Page speed is key to mobile usage of your website. The brand-building includes several things in today&#8217;s world, and one key is having a high-speed website that is quick to load on a mobile device. Some key areas to take care of include cache, image sizes, and redirects. The cache can help load the website faster, while smaller, more optimized images and lower redirects can also boost page speed.</p>
<p>Avoid elements on your website that can impact user experience. These include Flash, pop-ups, and intricate design. If you need to show special effects, try HTML5 instead. Popups do not display well on mobile sites and are difficult to close. Complicated designs can be difficult to navigate for people with smaller screen-sized phones or fat fingers. Use CSS to develop site display options and themes so that the website can adapt itself to different screens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If your business has finally been able to muster the courage and venture into the ever-growing world of technology and mobile apps, today’s your lucky day! Before being able to hire the best studio to develop one’s dearly beloved app, it’s important to answer these 5 key questions to help one make the best of decisions.</p>
<p>The chance of one’s business skyrocketing to success is can only an app away! But first, here are some key questions to ask yourself before hiring an App Development Studio:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4737 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-scaled.jpg" alt="5 Questions You Need To Evaluate the Right App Development Studio - infographic 10 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1920" height="936" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-scaled.jpg 1920w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-300x146.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-1024x499.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-768x374.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-1536x748.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-2048x998.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-960x468.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-600x292.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-1313x640.jpg 1313w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-800x390.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" title="5 Questions You Need To Evaluate the Right App Development Studio 3"></p>
<h2>1. Are Their Portfolios of My Liking?</h2>
<p>Finding an App Development Studio that suits one’s requirements the best can be a lot of work as it involves skimming through various app development portfolios and searching for the most successful app developers.</p>
<p>However, if one sees something they like, it’s probably the first sign that this could be the potential “right” App Studio. Look through their portfolios, many of which can be found on their websites, and see whether their work fits with what one has in mind for their own future business’ app. Be observant of how much progress they have made in the past year and whether they specialize in the industry that one requires (e.g. Fitness, Social Media or Games).</p>
<p>Not only that, but check the reviews for their apps online at the <a href="https://www.google.com.pk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV24TCuazXAhUGqo8KHSGeDwQQFggjMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%3Fhl%3Den&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Yjl1oQSF0yePbWWRpp2jt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Store</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com.pk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV4cjMuazXAhUJpI8KHfppDPQQFggjMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fgenre%2Fios%2Fid36%3Fmt%3D8&amp;usg=AOvVaw34cC7wO8XCwshkhf59tXG3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AppStore</a>. Do their customers complain of bugs and lagging of the app? Have they made improvements to their app after all the complaints? How many stars have people given their apps? Do extensive research regarding what various studios have put out into the world of apps and how successful have they been?</p>
<p>If one likes what they see, this is an indication of having answered the first essential question before hiring an App Development studio.</p>
<h2>2. Who Are Their Past and Present Clients? Are They Satisfied?</h2>
<p>Take a look at who their clients were and currently are. Get in touch with them, contact this studio’s clients and don’t be afraid to ask. Get to know how their experience was. Was it amazing? Was it satisfactory or was it horrid? Ask them about the challenges they faced, how the studio dealt with them as a client and would they be open to working with this studio again?</p>
<p>By digging deep and finding out others’ hands-on experience, one will be able to get an idea of what it would be like to work with this particular studio. This is how the second question regarding hiring the dream app development studio is answered.</p>
<p>Not only will this help in narrowing one’s decision as to which studios to worth spending time on, but it will help give one a clear idea of what kind of experience as well as a response they require by hiring a particular studio.</p>
<h2>3. What Platform Are They Capable of Developing For?</h2>
<p>If one aims to make an app accessible to all customers and users, what is the best platform to make it available on? If one already has a platform in mind, does this particular App Development Studio allow the business to release an app on it? Getting to know if the studio has the ability to develop an app that is more suited for iOS or Android users? Will the app be available to users of all devices or just some? Will the app be available worldwide or only in the Pakistan?</p>
<p>These questions are important to ask as well as answer in order to hire a studio that is able to fulfill the technical requirements.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=477687" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4223" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/58da17cf.jpg" alt="5 Questions You Need To Evaluate the Right App Development Studio - 58da17cf - Zera Creative" width="900" height="90" title="5 Questions You Need To Evaluate the Right App Development Studio 4"></a></p>
<h2>4. How Much Time Will It Take?</h2>
<p>How long will one be willing to wait for their dream app to be made? And how long will the App Development Studio take? If there’s a deadline that needs to be met, will this trusted studio be able to make it in time? Be sure to ask how practical it is for this studio to be able to produce what you want in the amount of time specified by them. If this particular studio is not too sure about delivering what one requires, look to hire another studio that can promise an efficient, quick, and responsible service.</p>
<p>Also, evaluate if support is provided after the development work is completed. If the warranty period is missing, or if support and maintenance are not provided, then it is time to look for a studio that does.</p>
<p>Maintenance and support can help with changes, new feature addition, and any updates that may be required due to OS updates. Zera Creative provides up to <a href="https://zeracreative.com/monthly-website-maintenance-service-pakistan/">3 months of free maintenance support</a> post-delivery, after which it provides support and maintenance at reasonable rates.</p>
<h2>5. How Much Will It Cost? Is This Studio Budget-Friendly?</h2>
<p>Now, this is an important question to ask. A lot of the time, companies and studios can be very promising and successful; however, they can be way out of the business’ budget. It’s better to choose a small, affordable studio rather than hiring an over-the-top, expensive, popular studio that leaves one in debt.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is essential to ask oneself whether hiring this studio will allow one to still remain within their financial boundaries.</p>
<h2>6. Will The App Make Money? How Will The Profit Be Split?</h2>
<p>Another important thing to consider asking is if the mobile app makes revenue, how much will the Studio charge? Will there be a 50-50 split on profit? It is important to decide how much is to be charged for the development of the app so that a studio can be hired that is able to deliver as well as keep their promise of charging fairly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, it can be said that hiring the <a href="https://zeracreative.com">perfect App Development Studio</a> takes time, effort, and in-depth research about what one actually expects from the launch of a mobile application. Nevertheless, if one looks hard and long enough, they’ll find what they’re looking for.</p>
