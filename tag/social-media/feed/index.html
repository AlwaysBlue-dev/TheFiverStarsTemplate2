										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Design studios are hard to find, those that fulfill all your requirements. Sometimes, they have great testimonials but their portfolio might leave something to be said. Or they have great design concepts in their portfolio, but their testimonials are far and few between. But finding the right design studio that gives you great customer service as well as work, is like finding a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>If you are on the lookout for a design studio that helps you climb the ladder of success in the business world, it can be quite a lot of work. However, once that perfect studio is found, you, as a small start-up or business may have the potential to skyrocket in terms of growth.</p>

<p>Here are 5 steps to follow in order to find your dream design studio:</p>
<h2>1. Keep The End Goal in Mind</h2>
<p>When looking for a design studio, keep in mind the requirements of your business needs. What is your aim after hiring them? How will this studio propel your business’s success? Remember the end goal of hiring a design studio for your business; this could be something along the lines of</p>
<ul>
<li>Initiate a new type of brand advertising which will create greater recognition for the business as well as generate monthly revenue and profits</li>
<li>Using the help of rebranding to increase sales by 10-20%</li>
<li>Developing a customer-centric mobile app that works to build customer engagement</li>
<li>Enhance <a href="https://zeracreative.com/best-seo-company-in-karachi/">SEO</a> of your blog to increase the visibility of your website to the world</li>
</ul>
<p>When you have set these goals, it is important that you note the areas of expertise your shortlisted design studios offer. Do they offer the services that will help you to meet these goals? Do they have the right portfolio to support these services? How popular is its social media presence? Are their testimonials supporting their services as well?</p>
<p>Make sure while hiring the design studio, that it not only “looks good,” but it has to be more specific, detailed, and much more meaningful. Write down a few goals and check which agency provides the greatest potential and ability to help the business out.</p>
<h2>2. Get Inspired</h2>
<p>Find popular, well-known agencies and <a href="https://zeracreative.com/branding-logo-design-company-pakistan/">design studios</a> and sift through their work. Does it serve as an inspiration? Is it in line with what you want your business to look like, or is your <a href="https://zeracreative.com/wordpress-development-company/">website</a> or mobile app, branding, exactly in line with what you have in mind? Find a particular design, font, layout, logo, colors, and inspirational images that catch your eye and which depict the feel of what you want from your brand, etc.</p>
<p>The more specific you are with your choices and inspirational feel, the greater the possibility of finding the best-suited studio. You can always go to Pinterest to decide on your inspiration.</p>
<h2>3. Start Searching</h2>
<p>Once proper outlines have been made regarding finding the best studio, it’s time to start searching. Now, this may take some work. First, start with one’s inner circle and business colleagues. Ask around about who knows of a few design studios and whether they can help out with getting in touch with them. Next, try searching online. Although Google may have innumerable results for the words “design studio,” try putting in one’s location to narrow down and find specific, helpful results.</p>
<p>Check out their <a href="https://zeracreative.com/work/">portfolios</a> and websites, see what one likes and delve further into the details. Do they update their website frequently? Do they have good reviews from their clients?  Look at which businesses they’ve worked for in the past and how successful have they been in giving their clients what they want.</p>
<p>By going through all this effort, finding a design studio that identifies with the business’ beliefs, ideologies, and guarantees to deliver become much easier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=477687" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4223" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/58da17cf.jpg" alt="5 Steps to Follow to Hire a Great Design Studio for your Business - 58da17cf - Zera Creative" width="900" height="90" title="5 Steps to Follow to Hire a Great Design Studio for your Business 4"></a></p>
<h2>4. Make The First Move</h2>
<p>Once you’ve narrowed down which design studios suit the business the best, start contacting them. The most common and efficient method is by picking up the phone or e-mailing the agencies. If composing an e-mail, make it formal as well as precise and make sure to leave all of your contact details so they can reach back easily.</p>
<p>Try and contact as many studios as possible, so that if one doesn’t respond, another surely will. Give every agency a full week to reply back, just in case they are busy with other clients. Once the replies come in, pay close attention to which agency responds best and which one makes the best connection with you. Comparing responses helps to decide which studio is more invested in working with you.</p>
<h2>5. Cost Effective</h2>
<p>One very important factor involved in finding the best designer studio is to consider the costs. Make sure that the preferred studio and your business are on the same page when it comes to the cost of producing and designing through the studio.</p>
<p>If you are a small start-up then the best studio would be the one that works on a small scale in a more affordable manner. It is essential that the budget is discussed before finalizing which designer studio to choose from. This way, finding the best designer studio becomes a whole lot easier and more effective!</p>
<p>Overall, it can be said that finding the best design studio that suits one’s needs will take time and research. But once the dream studio is found, a lovely partnership blossoms, guaranteeing success and growth for both, the studio and the business.</p>

<h2>Start Your Promotion From Home</h2>
<p>More often than not, blogs and businesses come up with great services, solutions, products, and content. But it keeps sitting on the shelves or websites waiting for someone to show up. Promotion of the brand, however, starts from home. Bring out your social media profiles, and actively promote your services and posts with your friends and family. If they are part of the audience profile you came up with, then these are the first step towards building a blog audience. Even though sometimes, they may not share the same view of how great your brand is, or could be, building numbers on your blog, product or service, can help build a better word of mouth.</p>
<h2>Work On Your Personal Profile</h2>
<p>Build and perfect your own personal profile first. Share your business profile URLs within your own profile, populate your about us section with key details of your business, and mention the kind of products and services you offer. Your personal profile should be a visual landscape of your business so that people can relate you to your business easily. Even if you do not portray yourself as a brand or a person behind your brand, you can still mark the products and services on your personal profile, to denote your support for them. Promote key elements of your business and your blog on your personal profile to indicate your support as well.</p>
<h2>Start Building A Network</h2>
<p>Building a network online and offline can be key in generating leads, building a blog audience, and promoting your brand to your target audiences. Networking can help with recall as people start recognizing the brand. This brand recall can become stronger the more you participate online as well as offline in the communities where your target audiences are found. For example, there are several groups on LinkedIn, Facebook and communities across different forums where your target audiences may hang out. Work to build a strong network in these communities, by helping answer queries, talking to people in general, and communicating with the audiences.</p>
<h2>Participate In All The Right Places</h2>
<p>While networking would indicate hanging out where your audiences are, and getting to know them. Participation would often involve you to be in places that your audiences would be. For example, if your audience profile is such that they would be found amongst social media channels such as LinkedIn and Snapchat that most businesses never think about, then, by all means, participate and use these channels.  If you are actively participating in channels that are the right fit with your blog audience, then you can continue to reap benefits as more visitors come on to your website.</p>
<h2>Engage With Your Target Audience</h2>
<p>While engagement and networking on social media platforms will bring you most of your audience, you should also consider engaging with your target blog audience on other platforms and forums. Social Media is one key to the larger scheme of finding and collecting audience. Another key is finding the audience on forums and communities where engagement can be done through answering questions, posting questions, and sharing anecdotes and stories. With this engagement, your net worth is built and your expertise is highlighted. Quora is a general forum where all sort of audience is found. You can conduct a basic Google Search to find communities that resonate with your brand, to find more audiences there.</p>
<h2>Claim Your Name</h2>
<p>While social media can be a great audience builder, a key tip that most entrepreneurs fail to realize is that your name should be standard across all platforms. This includes your domain name, your social media channel names across different mediums, and your profiles. A singular name can help in finding your social media pages/profiles quickly rather than having to hunt through them. This can build familiarity amongst your audience for an easier transition from your social media page or profile to your website.</p>
<h2>Get Yourself Published</h2>
<p>Most small businesses have found their audiences and claim to fame, through getting published in larger publications. If you prefer to have your name out there amongst your key visitors, then aim to get published. Some key publications that take in articles from various bloggers and businesses include Huffington Post, Forbes, Inc.com, BuzzFeed, and more. You should also use mediums such as LinkedIn and Medium to build your and your brand&#8217;s online presence. It helps when a person searches out on the search engine and comes across details that build your online presence and display you as an expert or a knowledge leader in your field.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Forget Local Networking</h2>
<p>While most businesses work on building a seamless <a href="https://zeracreative.com/">social media</a> presence, local networking is often forgotten. A lot of your audience can come directly from word of mouth. Find out local networking groups, volunteering options, churches, and meetups that you can go to. These have people who are generally going to be like-minded. They will be more in tune based on the kind of audience profile you have created. These audiences can be a great boost in terms of word of mouth for your business as well as your blog.</p>
<h2>Get Your Business Cards Out</h2>
<p>Business cards are often the least used item in a small business or blog. But they can bring about a great boost to your blog if used in the right manner. A business card generally should contain social media channel IDs as well for the receiver to relate to your social media presence. Business cards can help you connect with your audience. They are a great help in brand recall when the receiver views the card again. Both physical and digital business cards can help in this case.</p>
<h2>Get Your Audience To Share</h2>
<p>Once your audience is visiting your blog or your website, the next step is to add options that allow your audience to share your goodness with the world. If you use a WordPress website, there are some key plugins that allow you to create toolbars for social media sharing. Similarly, for other websites built on other platforms, you can build social media sharing toolbars that allow your audience to share your posts, products or services on their profiles.</p>
<h2>Add Click to Tweet Options</h2>
<p>A key trick that quite a few blogs have used recently for good measure is the <a href="https://clicktotweet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click to Tweet</a> Option. You can also build this feature in your blog through plugins and codes. A specific phrase or sentence can be converted into a tweet and embedded into your content. The audience can readily share that piece on their Twitter profile by clicking on the Click To Tweet button. This way, your content is shared with the world, without significant effort from the audience itself. You can leverage social media profiles of your readers to get more audience onto your website this way.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Forget Lesser Used Channels</h2>
<p>More often than not, you can find your blog audience on social media channels that you may personally not be using. For example, some audience may be available on Pinterest, Instagram, Snapchat and LinkedIn. Usually, we may use these channels as a user but not as a small business owner or a blogger. However, these are great hubs to find great audience profiles and build your <a href="https://zeracreative.com/">social media</a> presence. For example, Pinterest is a key tool that a lot of people use to search for relevant content. You can leverage this idea by promoting your products, services and blog posts directly to your blog audience, on Pinterest boards for people to find, share and redirect to your <a href="https://zeracreative.com/">website</a>!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Running a successful fashion/beauty salon with the current cut-throat competition in the field is a definitely a difficult task. One needs to utilize all resources available for promotion and marketing in order to reach the clientele and maintain a profitable business. The best way to do this is through the web – Digital Marketing is the best and most convenient solution.</p>
<p>Taking a leaf out of their book will help your business prosper by connecting with the customers at a personal level. Here are some helpful tips for all new as well as existing beauty salon owners:</p>
<h2><b>Website</b></h2>
<p>Making a website is the first thing that you should invest in. The layout should portray the theme of your salon as well as be attractive enough to keep the interest of the website visitor. Clear tabs with information about your salon, your theme/motto and the services that are offered (you may or may not include a rate card) are essential. The website can also include a soothing background music and pictures of the staff and happy customers. Contact details and address are obviously a must!</p>
<h2><b>Social Networks</b></h2>
<p>Once your website is up and running, the next digital media sector that you should target are the social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest etc. Take a look at the existing pages of beauty salons across the nation and in your city. A fun and interactive page are what is required to be maintained. For example, regular tweets with latest fashion and beauty related topics can be uploaded to Twitter &amp; Pinterest.</p>
<h2>Use Facebook’s Potential</h2>
<p>Facebook is an excellent forum for promotion and marketing because of its multiple interactive features. Regular updates about client sessions (satisfied customers will be more than happy to pose for a picture) in the salon can be done by your employees. Professionalism needs to be maintained. Uploading pictures or videos of the latest trends in beauty, makeup, hairstyles, fashion and related areas will keep the interest of the page visitors active.</p>
<h2>Interactive Sessions</h2>
<p>Interactive sessions with your stylists can be arranged on any social media site wherein the clients can directly chat with your stylists and clear their doubts. Also, special offers or coupons can be given out especially for your Facebook fans or Twitter followers.</p>
<h2>Online Appointments</h2>
<p>The option of setting up an appointment online should be made available on all these forums.</p>
<p>Following these simple steps will definitely give your salon business a boost and enable you to reach a variety of clientele. With people checking their Facebook and Twitter almost every hour, you are bound to get the exposure that you desire and excel by providing the best customer service.</p>

<h2>Use Pictures</h2>
<p>In the fashion world, it is all about visuals. That is why you should establish your presence on social media platforms that are specifically for pictures. These include Pinterest and Instagram. Both these portals are all about pictures and are the best for a fashion business. Of course, you may use Facebook and Twitter but even on these portals, it is advised that you speak through pictures and limit text.</p>
<h2>Customize Your Messages</h2>
<p>It is totally unacceptable to upload the same message on all social media portals. This is because your followers on Twitter have a completely different train of thought when compared to your followers on Instagram. On Twitter, you will see people who are more into technology while Facebook is for everyone. Instagram is specifically for those who love sharing images, as is Pinterest. This is why you should segment your messages based on the platform you are using. Generic messages will not appeal to everyone.</p>
<h2>Establish A Connection</h2>
<p>On social media, direct promotion of your fashion business will not help you at all. Social media is a portal to share information and to connect first. Only then should you think of promoting yourself. Also, the promotion should be discreet. Your focus should be on establishing a connection with your audience by narrating stories about lifestyle. You may also get in touch with your customers to share their stories.</p>
<p>Most of them will be happy to do so. When you share these stories you will attract others as well. You also have the option of creating suggestive, beautiful stories of lifestyle that may appeal to your target audience.</p>
<h2>Retarget Your Visitor With Facebook Ads To Increase Conversion Rates</h2>
<p>Most people are not ready to buy immediately upon seeing an ad or visiting your website. With retargeting you’re able to reach the same people that were thinking about buying your product with reminder ads.</p>
<p>You can retarget visitors to your website by creating <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-website-custom-audiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Custom Audiences</a> with Facebook (with just a snippet of code), and target <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-website-custom-audiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lookalike Audiences</a> as well to expand your reach.</p>
<p>If they don’t purchase—let’s say after a week—you can give them a slight discount in the ad to get them to act. Retargeting people who have abandoned their shopping cart is also a fantastic way to generate sales that otherwise would have been lost.</p>

<h2>Create Style Guides</h2>
<p>Create style guides to show your visitors how to wear or incorporate your items into their everyday life.</p>
<p>If you own a fashion brand that sells a variety of clothing items, put together a style guide for your website so that visitors and subscribers can get ideas on how to wear your clothing, and even incorporate pieces into their existing wardrobe.</p>
<p>Don’t limit yourself to just one guide. Style guides can be done seasonally (spring, summer, fall, winter), for special occasions (wedding, party, picnic), holidays (Eid, Christmas, New Year’s), and for more topical themes: travel, work, weekend, beach.</p>
<p>Here is the great example of one of our client: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/closetfashionpk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Closet Fashion</a><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1456 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/closet-fashion-instagram.png" alt="Best Tips to Generate More Customers from Social Media For Fashion Business - closet fashion instagram - Zera Creative" width="890" height="522" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/closet-fashion-instagram.png 890w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/closet-fashion-instagram-300x176.png 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/closet-fashion-instagram-768x450.png 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/closet-fashion-instagram-600x352.png 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/closet-fashion-instagram-800x469.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px" title="Best Tips to Generate More Customers from Social Media For Fashion Business 13"></p>
<p>Guides can be listed as a special section on your website and incorporated into your blog or Instagram, where you can provide more in-depth information on each item in the collection. Try telling a story with the style guide to interest your customer.</p>
<h2>Work With Influencers</h2>
<p>Yes, work with influencers in your category to provide you with access to a new audience, gain social proof, and receive unique content.</p>
<p>To get in front of your ideal audience, work with a popular fashion vlogger or blogger that already has a dedicated following of people who would like your brand. Those with large audiences have built a reputation and are well respected by their readers. They can have a huge impact if they choose to mention, review, or even wear your products. <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7222" src="https://uhurunetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fashion-Digital-Marketing-to-increase-sales.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="https://uhurunetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fashion-Digital-Marketing-to-increase-sales.jpg 300w, https://uhurunetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fashion-Digital-Marketing-to-increase-sales-150x150.jpg 150w, https://uhurunetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fashion-Digital-Marketing-to-increase-sales-299x300.jpg 299w" alt="Fashion Digital Marketing to Increase Sales" width="300" height="301" title="Best Tips to Generate More Customers from Social Media For Fashion Business 14"></p>
<p>You can work with them to create content around a specific campaign or just create gorgeous images with your product. Their influence and creative take on your product will garner great interaction and sales.</p>
<p>Working with bloggers gives you two huge things: you get in front of a new audience and, if you selected the correct influencer, then you’ll gain new customers and the blogger will create content for you. Depending on the collaboration, they will share custom content on their blog, and social channels, and you (the brand) may also get the opportunity to use the content they produce.</p>
<p>When collaborating with a blogger, you can also run Facebook ads featuring the photos of the bloggers to send traffic their way, and in turn, get your product(s) noticed. (Make sure you get a signed agreement before posting images of them and/or their logo.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PRO TIP</strong>: When working with bloggers, provide a brand guide so you give them more guidance and they create the content you’re looking for.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Do Not Try Too Hard</h2>
<p>The more you push, the harder you will fall. This is the mantra on social media. Do not force yourself on social media or push on your customers to buy from you. Keep it interactive and simple, full of colorful images that will attract your target audience. All the content, visual or textual, should be relevant, decent, and interesting.</p>
<blockquote><p>Social media is extremely powerful, especially for the fashion business. Use it to the fullest so that your business sees a boost.</p></blockquote>
