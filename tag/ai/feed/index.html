										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AI wonders are making graphic design agencies giddy with excitement and terrifying them at the same time. Its massive transformation into the tech world has shaken numerous industries and the design world is no exception.</p>
<p>Where newbies fear AI to be a substitute, professionals know how to leverage its full capacities. So, if you are wondering how the technology can help transform the design industry and what ways AI can assist an ethical designer, here&#8217;s the blog to find your answers.</p>
<h2>Growth and Application of AI Across Major Industries</h2>
<p>AI has experienced a snowballing adoption rate over the years due to its uncompromising efficiency and advances. According to the <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/3104/artificial-intelligence-ai-worldwide/#dossierKeyfigures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statista report</a>, the global market size reached $327.5 billion in 2021.</p>
<p>Whereas, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-11-22-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-artificial-intelligence-software-market-to-reach-62-billion-in-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner</a> predicted AI software to reach $62 billion in 2022 alone. The global annual revenue of AI software currently is around $50 billion, see below:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4349" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies.png" alt="Future of AI Designs: Guide For Graphic Design Agencies - future of ai designs guide for graphic design agencies - Zera Creative" width="532" height="391" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies.png 532w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies-300x220.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px" title="Future of AI Designs: Guide For Graphic Design Agencies 4"></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.tractica.com/research/artificial-intelligence-market-forecasts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Omdia</a></p>
<p>AI software integrates a business with its uncountable benefits. Reduced operational time, greater business insights, automation, enhanced productivity and reduced human error are some it powers up any business.</p>
<p>At present, tech giants such as Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft are spending billions of dollars on AI products and services. However, considering the potential of Artificial Intelligence, universities are making it a prominent part of their curricula. All the major industries have now untapped the undeniable significance and the role of AI to influence innovation and advancements in terms of productivity, security and efficiency. So, how does AI transform the design industry? Let&#8217;s dive deep below:</p>
<h2>Future of AI Designs: Rising Above the Hype</h2>
<p>To let AI assist graphic design agencies with its full capacity and potential there is a need to first deconstruct it. Instead of thinking about AI as <strong>“artificial intelligence”</strong>– a substitute, consider it as <strong>“augmented intelligence”</strong>. Designers need to conceptualise AI as a tool that augments the level of intelligence in a service in terms of its overall quality or productivity.</p>
<p>AI bots are not replacing designers but instead assisting them in terms of optimization and speed. A designer using AI software tends to create designs faster and with greater proficiency. AI bots have the power to analyze vast amounts of data and offer accurate suggestions to enable a designer to create a most engaging and industry-specific design.</p>
<h3>Speedy Design Prototyping</h3>
<p>With the help of AI tools, designers can create multiple prototype versions that can be A/B tested with users. The tools assist in scanning basic sketches for speedy design prototyping. In the AI tool users enter a few parameters and get a library full of UI components that provide a prototype which is aligned with the company&#8217;s design system. Airbnb is one of those early adopters who are using this technology to generate design components using computer vision-enabled AI and machine learning.</p>
<h3>Seamless Product Localization</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4350" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies-zera-creative.png" alt="Future of AI Designs: Guide For Graphic Design Agencies - future of ai designs guide for graphic design agencies zera creative - Zera Creative" width="670" height="234" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies-zera-creative.png 670w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies-zera-creative-300x105.png 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies-zera-creative-600x210.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" title="Future of AI Designs: Guide For Graphic Design Agencies 5"></p>
<p>AI has introduced game-changing models to integrate personalization in the design industry. Google, Facebook and Netflix have been using AI technology to capture the attention of their users and keep them engrossed in their platforms. Two major problems that every designer has encountered were product localisation and the translation of a design into multiple languages, both of these issues are now fully catered to by AI.</p>
<p>Google’s neural machine translation embedded AI bots allows users instantly translate visual information into another language. Moreover, Netflix is leveraging AI to localization of show banners into different languages along with artwork personalization. With AI bots the localized and personalized graphics are instantly created without there need for designers to spend time on them. All that is needed is a skim through to approve or reject the design if necessary.</p>
<h3>Unique Packaging Designs</h3>
<p>A human mind may seize to restrict its capabilities under a certain condition or situation. For instance, for a designer to create multiple unique copies for the same brand having the same ideology is a bit complicated. However, with the help of AI, a professional can commit millions of unique designs with each having incredibly engaging creativity.</p>
<p>The AI algorithms untapped dozens of distinctive patterns, colours and aesthetics creating seven million unique <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2017/06/01/algorithm-seven-million-different-jars-nutella-packaging-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">packaging designs for Nutella</a>. It accelerated the product sales that were presented with captivating designs printed on the front of each jar in Italy. The technology usurped the traditional role of a graphic designer to spend hours creating unique designs.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4351" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/nutella-ai-packaging.png" alt="Future of AI Designs: Guide For Graphic Design Agencies - nutella ai packaging - Zera Creative" width="412" height="392" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/nutella-ai-packaging.png 412w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/nutella-ai-packaging-300x285.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px" title="Future of AI Designs: Guide For Graphic Design Agencies 6"></p>
<h2>The Need For Graphic Designers To Co-Create With AI</h2>
<p>AI design software enables designers to produce eye-catching designs faster and quicker. The bots refine a product&#8217;s image by successfully comparing it with millions of others. it helps in generating enhanced user engagements.</p>
<p>Moreover, by incorporating a personalized touch into the designs brands can generate an accelerated ROI. AI targets multiple data points to fully comprehend a user&#8217;s journey and enables designers the rich data to create the most targetted designs.</p>
<p>AI using facial recognition is able to determine age, gender, context, location and the current mood of users. With this data, a UX designer can target the audience more efficiently.<br />
According to the research, the use of digital assistance by 2021 would reach 1.8B. Hence, with the use of coupling AI and voice recognition, UX designers are able to create speedier and more efficient designs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, AI enables designers to leverage usability metrics. It processes a large amount of data that results in the creation of high-performing designs for products. Lastly, by co-creating with AI, designers can ponder on how users read and look at data that can help them in paying more attention to important areas to target.</p>

<p>We live in a world that is dominated by technology. The things we see, the work we do, and the way we interact with the things around us, are all impacted by technology. On one hand, where this huge inheritance of innovation is making lives more convenient, it is also opening up a higher level of clutter amongst organizations that revolve their businesses around these technologies.</p>
<p>The most recent innovation that is sweeping every industry off its feet is <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artificial Intelligence</a></strong>. While it has a been a while since AI made its arrival; it is now that every industry is actually embracing its potential.</p>
<p>Amongst all, the one industry that has one of the most customer-centric workings is E-Commerce. Many e-commerce businesses have already inculcated Artificial Intelligence in their organizations and are catering to better results.</p>
<p>In this blog, we have covered the influence of <strong>AI on e-commerce businesses</strong>, and the different ways in which organizations use it.</p>
<h2><strong>Defining the Concept of Artificial Intelligence</strong></h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence demonstrates the machines that are intelligent and capable enough to perform tasks and function on their own. The machines that assimilate AI are designed in a way that they can think and behave like a human.</p>
<p>This capability has given a rise to businesses in choosing to integrate with Artificial Intelligence, in order to enhance their overall efficiency and productivity. Over the years, the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/607716/worldwide-artificial-intelligence-market-revenues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">market for AI has seen a tremendous rise</a>; in 2016, the global market of AI was approximately worth 3,221 billion US dollars. As of 2025, it will reach approximately 89,847 billion US dollars.</p>

<h2><strong>Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>In the current scenario of the market where AI is bringing forth a lot of opportunities, being innovative is the key to success. The importance that this technology is getting has edged marketers to integrate AI into their business.</p>
<p>Following are some of the most common techniques in which <a href="/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>app development companies</strong></a> are making use of AI.</p>
<h3><strong>Using Chatbots</strong>:</h3>
<p>Over the years, there has been a rapid shift in the focus of businesses in regard to the users. Initially, it stood at catering to a bigger market, but it has now come to generate a great experience for the users. Many retailers have taken a better understanding of Artificial Intelligence and are incorporating techniques like Chatbots to improve the experience of users.</p>
<p>Now, what exactly is a Chatbot? In the most basic terms, a bot is a computer program that has been developed in a way that it indulges in conversations with the users in a completely human-like manner.</p>
<p>Big brands like H&amp;M, Amazon &amp; Walmart completely depend on chatbots for answering to the queries of the customers. Because the bots answer in a very conversational way (even though they are supposed to be mechanical), they have been gaining a lot of popularity. So much, so that when a user talks to the bot, it creates an illusion that a human is answering the queries!</p>
<p>Also, bots give very instant responses, eliminating the chances of users having to wait for a long period of time.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1933 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hm-chatbot.png" alt="How is Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce? - hm chatbot - Zera Creative" width="750" height="332" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hm-chatbot.png 750w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hm-chatbot-300x133.png 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hm-chatbot-600x266.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" title="How is Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce? 15"></p>
<p>Chatbots are connected with Artificial Intelligence and are hence trained to answer questions in the most relevant manner. It understands and learns from the interactions it has with users, stores them, and uses them to give answers in the future.</p>
<p>The best part about bots is that it not only improve the experience of users on the app, it is also increasing the productivity of the organization. Bots are efficiently saving the time of the employee who otherwise would have been delegated to respond to these queries of users!</p>
<h3><strong>Managing the inventory in organizations</strong>:</h3>
<p>The constant pain that employees face is keeping a track of everything in an organization. Be it as small as a pin, you will have to keep the inventory up to date. The predictive nature of Artificial Intelligence has taken care of managing the inventory!</p>
<p>Based on the working of AI, it collects and analyses the important factors that drive the demand for major requirements in the market, predicts what their future demands would be, and that gives the organizations a benefit in knowing their inventory needs!</p>
<h3><strong>Easier customer searches:</strong></h3>
<p>If we look at it from the perspective of the users, it is very difficult to find the exact thing that you are looking for. Of course, users can spend hours on search engines trying to find what they are looking for, but the chances of coming across that exact thing are slight.</p>
<p>Thanks to the tech-friendly world we are living in, Artificial Intelligence has the perfect solution for this! AI assists the customers in finding what they were looking for in a much more natural way.</p>
<p>Take for instance, in the app <a href="https://www.gofind.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go Find</a>, you can take a picture of whatever you like. The app will bring similar-looking results from its stores.</p>
<p>The Echo Look by Amazon uses a camera integrated with Artificial Intelligence. It gives recommendations about what looks best on the user!</p>
<p>The whole concept of AI is eliminating the need for typing search words to look for something. It is now shifting to using visuals to complete that task, making the process more interesting.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1936 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/artificial-intelligence-impacting-e-commerce-go-find-visual-fashion-search.jpg" alt="How is Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce? - artificial intelligence impacting e commerce go find visual fashion search - Zera Creative" width="750" height="320" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/artificial-intelligence-impacting-e-commerce-go-find-visual-fashion-search.jpg 750w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/artificial-intelligence-impacting-e-commerce-go-find-visual-fashion-search-300x128.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/artificial-intelligence-impacting-e-commerce-go-find-visual-fashion-search-600x256.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" title="How is Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce? 16"></p>
<h3><strong>Create an interactive sales process</strong>:</h3>
<p>Given the high level of competition in every domain today, it is pretty difficult to reach out to the customers and offer them the most appropriate services. Which is why the integration of Artificial Intelligence in managing the customers’ time efficiently. It understands the choices of the users before providing any customized solutions.</p>
<p>Also, it deploys the time of the users only in the areas required. It also ensures that they don’t see any inappropriate products. For instance, The North Face uses “IBM Watson”. It asks the users choice-related questions like “Where will you be using the jacket?”. Based on the answers, it brings forth the most relevant products.</p>
<h3><strong>Channeling a new level of personalization</strong>:</h3>
<p>Regardless of who the user is or what they want, they would want a personalized experience on the app. Rather than generalizing the needs of the users, the algorithms of Artificial Intelligence can be utilized to cater the personalized content for the users. That would give them a better and more optimized experience.</p>
<p>This can be illustrated by an example; suppose a user is browsing for a superhero tee on a website from their laptop. Now, they can receive advertisements about any offers or sales related to that search when they open any social media platform (eg. Facebook, Instagram) from their mobile phone as well.</p>

<h3><strong>Virtual assistants</strong>:</h3>
<p>Being a part of the tech world has accustomed us to expect a higher level of convenience with every new technology that envelopes us. The concept of Virtual Assistants like Siri &amp; Alexa has opened up new opportunities for users.</p>
<p>They are already impacting the way users do their purchasing. By helping out in practically every task that users perform on a website or app, virtual assistants have made e-commerce a successful domain.</p>
<p>Right from navigating the users from one location on the app to another, to finding something for them, to placing their order, the integration of virtual assistants has reached the next level!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1934" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/artificial-intelligence-integrating-e-commerce-alexa-siri.png" alt="How is Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce? - artificial intelligence integrating e commerce alexa siri - Zera Creative" width="750" height="375" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/artificial-intelligence-integrating-e-commerce-alexa-siri.png 750w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/artificial-intelligence-integrating-e-commerce-alexa-siri-300x150.png 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/artificial-intelligence-integrating-e-commerce-alexa-siri-600x300.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" title="How is Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce? 18"></p>
<h2><strong>Biggest Brands using Artificial Intelligence</strong></h2>
