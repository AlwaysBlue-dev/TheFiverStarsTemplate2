<p>1. Positioning Through Visibility</h2>
<p>Business is all about <em>positioning</em>.</p>
<p>If you’re one up in a position to your target audience, you can mint far more dollars and authority over them. Whereas, if you reach them out, you hand over that positioning prowess to them.</p>
<p>We know it’s a bit of a “wrapping head around” concept, but hold tight we will walk you through it… Positioning in terms of SEO means is, when we create content based on customers&#8217; problems, we position ourselves as those who will help them out.</p>
<p>Those who’re solving problems while asking nothing for it at first. This gives you a massive positioning edge, and if you continuously produce content that steers them to your solution.</p>
<p>Voila! You have a secret to their heart and their sacred money… But, hey! This isn’t that easier than you might think.</p>
<p>To really get benefit from a position through SEO, you MUST gain top Google places for most keywords that journey your customers to your offer.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.zerolimitweb.com/organic-vs-ppc-2021-ctr-results-best-practices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">71.33% clicks happen</a> on the first page of Google for any search term.</p>
<p>If you don’t know how to secure top places, you can reach us and we’re happy to <a href="/contact">assist</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Web Traffic Without Banking On Ads</h2>
<p>As we all know that paid ads can take a toll on your budget and squeeze it out, if the targeting wasn’t on point, or the message wasn’t as effective.</p>
<p>There are other crucial tricks of the trades that also need to be considered for running paid campaigns. Relying totally on them is a Nah! Nah! strategy.</p>
<p>And as we touched on earlier, reaching them out by targeting them instead of them reaching you out is a low-position, low-status strategy…<br />
Point is, to generate a stable business where customers could come and knock on your door while you sleep day in and day out &#8212; SEO would be your best bet.</p>
<p>No! We aren’t against paid marketing…</p>
<p>In fact, we are huge proponents of that. But what you need to understand is, Paid ads can help you acquire leads in days, though you can’t always bank on Paid ads due to certain complications and always the risk of losing money.</p>
<p>Plus, here you’re reaching them out, &#8212; remember positioning?</p>
<h2>3. Improves Trustworthiness</h2>
<p>Where their money is involved, there is some sure doubt. Doubt could be related to anything…</p>
<p>Optimizing your content is a wonderful way to subdue any doubts. Let’s understand this concept with a scenario, when your customers want to do business with you, especially if big bucks are involved, they would definitely run a Google search.</p>
<p>To see what you’re up to… This is something you might have done as well… Haven’t you?</p>
<p>When you optimize your website or online business for search engines, your customers will deem you worthy as a lot would pop up when they search.</p>
<p>Also, when they go through the content you’ve created, it further plants a seed in their heads of trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Which would give you a massive positioning edge… Not only will your customers shoot to work with you, but also they’d be willing to pay you the premium.</p>
<h2>4. Can Sell To Customers Using Targeted Keywords</h2>
<p>Did you know <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/87-of-shoppers-now-begin-product-searches-online/530139/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">87% of shoppers</a> find products through online search?</p>
<p>Not 10, 20, or 50… It’s 87%! What it illustrates is if businesses don’t optimize their websites for search engines, they leave an enormous sum of money on the table. What about those who optimize? Well, they’re having a ball… Simple as that.</p>
<p>Here’s your opportunity to craft content around keywords that your audience is searching for so you can nudge your target audience towards a solution. (Whisper* your solution). We can’t emphasize enough on this. Again it boils down to <em>positioning</em>. (Ugh, yet again…)</p>
<p>The more you show up for keywords your target audience is searching for, the better positioning you’ll have that you can leverage to sell them. You can search out what keywords your target market is mostly searching for and create content around it. Isn&#8217;t it awesome? BTW, winning top search engine places in the neck-to-neck online competition is a ferocious task that requires a heck load of work and an understanding of certain strategies.</p>
<p>If you stuck to this, who would focus on scaling the business? Amidst of all this, you can reach us out and we’ll help you <a href="https://zeracreative.com/seo-company-pakistan/">rank your website higher in google search</a>.</p>
<h2>5. SEO for Better User Experience UI</h2>
<p>A website that follows good SEO practices always gives off a better user experience. Let us explain this to you, people consider those two aspects separate, however, they are as interlinked as online business and internet connection.</p>
<p>Without an internet connection, online business is nothing but a mere dream and vice versa. Same as, aesthetics and clear navigations are important both for user experience to flip pages and pace around without much problem and for SEO… Without optimizing website aesthetics and ensuring sleek navigations Google will deduct SEO points. Since navigation tells Google what the content is about, and in which category it lies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=477687" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4223" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/58da17cf.jpg" alt="7 Reasons Why SEO is necessary for Your Online Business - 58da17cf - Zera Creative" width="900" height="90" title="7 Reasons Why SEO is necessary for Your Online Business 4"></a></p>
<p>And aesthetics make it easy for users to stay around for long. The point being SEO and UI go hand in hand. Let’s understand this with another example, take page speed and Mobile friendliness for the matter of discussion… <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/mobile-page-speed-google-rankings-user-experience/234739/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Page speed and mobile friendliness</a> are two important aspects of user experience.</p>
<p>Without a responsive and fast site, a website would always repel users. Since it repels users, it’s bad for SEO. And because of these two reasons Google deems content unworthy and relegates it below competitors. The point is for a good website it must have proper integration of SEO and UI.</p>
<h2>6. Market Knowledge</h2>
<p>SEO helps understand what’s working in the industry. The more you bank on SEO, the more you remain on top of the trends. What it means, to stay competitive in your industry on Google SERPs, you must know what are the latest updates in your industry.</p>
<p>Upon knowing, create content around the hot topics. Because if you don’t your competitors will. And that’s not a good place to be in. Right?</p>
<p><strong>Staying up to date with the trends has two benefits:,</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>You can turn a lot of visitors to your website by leveraging the power of currently in-demand or top-of-the-head topics that your target audience is searching for.<br />
<strong>B: </strong>Based on what’s currently working, you can predict the forthcoming trends and make your strategy regarding it beforehand.</p>
<p>This is the easiest way to hack your way to profits.</p>
<h2>7. Long-Term Strategy That Pays Dividends</h2>
<p>We said it before, and we are saying it again. SEO is not flipping your fingers to get clients&#8217; strategy… It’s a long arduous strategy that initially won’t add much to your bottom line, but 6 months later, or a year later you’d witness some changes.</p>
<p>More inbound leads are coming to fill out the form to work with you or buy your product. Provided that your website is properly optimized on the latest Google guidelines. If it’s, congratulations, you’re about to take off and make huge leaps in your business.</p>
<h2>Wrap Up</h2>
<p>This post enlightens you about the effectiveness of SEO for online businesses. For businesses that intend to flourish and generate organic and inbound leads while they sleep, then there’s no better strategy than doing proper SEO of your website.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that it takes time to pick up the momentum and win Google&#8217;s trust. Are you ready to run a marathon?</p>
<p>Anyway, if you are unsure of the process, &#8212; don’t &#8212; just don’t, we’ll take care of it. If you <a href="/contact">head to us</a>, we ensure we do proper <a href="https://zeracreative.com/best-seo-company-in-karachi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO of your website</a> that beats competitors over time and win you organic leads.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you started a new business or a company? That means you definitely got a website and trying to get visibility in search engines. In the current day and age, it has been a tough task for a business or website owner to get visibility in search engines.

As a result, your website would get an influx of new traffic and a potential audience.</p>
<p>But, to get the display in the top search results, you need to sail through ranking factors that are set by the search engines to determine your website visibility in the search results. Nevertheless, start applying the basic SEO techniques to your site and once you are used to them and feel comfortable, you could learn new SEO techniques and apply them to your Startup Company or business website.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4741 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-12-scaled.jpg" alt="4 Simple SEO Techniques For Startups - infographic 12 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1920" height="1898" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-12-scaled.jpg 1093w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-12-300x297.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-12-1024x1012.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-12-768x759.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-12-1536x1518.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-12-2048x2024.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-12-960x949.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-12-600x593.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-12-648x640.jpg 648w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-12-800x791.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" title="4 Simple SEO Techniques For Startups 6"></p>
<h2>1. Create a Website That Could Be Indexed</h2>
<p>This is the utmost and most important thing in SEO. Hence, create a website that could be indexed by search engines, because the search engines run automated programs called ‘spiders’ in between internal and external links of a website in storing database known as ‘Index’. This makes the search engines show up the website results in search results, whenever a user enters a search query.</p>
<h2>2. Keyword Research</h2>
<p>You need to know that the search results for a query appear based on the keywords, thus making the SEO dependent on finding out the ‘Keywords’. In the <a href="https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2012/07/23/a-6-step-process-for-keyword-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">process of  Keyword Research</a>, you have to concentrate on both branded and industry keywords both as well. Industry keywords comprise generic queries such as ‘Software Applications’ and ‘Online Training’, while ‘Brand Keywords’ comprise the phrases around the name and URL of your company.</p>
<p>However, while determining the keywords for your business or company website, you need to determine them based on the metrics like Search Volume in a Month Competition Levels (Other Website Pages for a particular query) and the mission of your website (Website Relevant). These factors give you a list of keywords, out of which you have to shortlist 5 to 10 targeted keywords for your <a href="https://zeracreative.com/website-development-company-in-karachi-pakistan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">startup website</a>.</p>
<h2>3. Quality Content</h2>
<p>Using the finalized keywords, you need to create potential and quality content on your website. Because the more content you have on your website the more chances you get to rank high for various keywords in search results. Besides, the visitors will share your content amongst them if it is really good enough that creates brand recognition for your company.</p>
<h2>4. Link Building</h2>
<p>This factor also plays a key role in overall performance in search results. Therefore, you need to build quality and <a href="https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/backlinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantity backlinks</a> directing back to your website/web pages. You could gain backlinks by offering guest posts to other websites, which include a backlink to your web pages, press releases through major news resources, and spreading content on social media networks with an intention to get shared by your followers.</p>
<p>The above discussed are just basic SEO techniques but are still helpful if you are new to this industry. However, ensure to learn further techniques and apply them on your website to skyrocket the performance of your startup business or company.</p>
