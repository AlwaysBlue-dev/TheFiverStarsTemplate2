										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is WordPress Good for Ecommerce? We might have the answer. Soon after the pandemic hits the world, the physical stores in most parts of the world shut down &#8211; due to the contagiousness of the novel COVID-19. With that, citizens across the world have started paying more heed to online selling &amp; buying and it continues to grow strong every passing day.</p>
<p>Sniffing the trend, some smart people have decided to either completely shift their business to online or add online selling into the marketing mix.</p>
<p>To function stores online and sell the items, there’s a need for a platform that hosts the store. Since you’re here reading the content, you’re planning to open an online store and are actively looking for a better option to host your store on. Since WordPress is a well-known content management system and website builder, you want to know whether WordPress is good for eCommerce websites.</p>
<p><strong>WordPress can be potent for an eCommerce website/store or can be totally fatal &#8211; depending upon the business need. For example, for a business with a few products, WordPress is the best option and for stores with a 100s product list — other options could be better. </strong></p>
<p>Is it enough to drive a decision?</p>
<p>Well, there are so many factors combined to formulate a decision, and by the end of the post you would know<br />
When you could use WordPress for <a href="/ecommerce-website-development-services-pakistan/">eCommerce </a>and when to shift to other popular eCommerce platforms like <a href="https://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopify</a> and Magento.</p>
<p>When to host a <a href="https://zeracreative.com/wordpress-development-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website on WordPress</a> and when shouldn’t.</p>
<p>Whether WordPress is secured for ecommerce websites and does it provide better security?</p>
<p>What is that <strong>one Reason</strong> where WordPress becomes a no brainer? Even if all other requirements go against the decision</p>
<p>So, without further ado, let’s dive into considerations,</p>
<h2>Consideration before choosing any host for your store</h2>
<h4>The Size of your store drives your choice</h4>
<p>The size and the products in your eCommerce store are the key factors to drive the decision.</p>
<p>Stores that are big and have a lot of products require prompt handling, which includes clear listings, sleek and intuitive navigations, and much more. Whereas, small stores with fewer products don’t need outrageous handling.</p>
<p>That says if the store is big enough, it would have more problems, especially in regard to maintenance of server and theme. Since WordPress’s WooCommerce is open-source and extremely customizable with third-party plugins and themes, it risks the potential of breaking your store.<br />
How?<br />
The plugins and theme used could have loopholes and errands for malicious coding–any abrupt changes could damage the site completely. Or routinely maintenance could waste a lot of time- which you could invest in doing something productive for your business.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there’re a lot of amazing and huge eCommerce stores based on WordPress’s WooCommerce and are running smoothly. The fact is, these stores used highly paid themes and well-coded glitch-free plugins, backed up by good web hosts. Alongside, it requires maintenance fees.</p>
<p>However, if your store doesn’t require prompt handling, and doesn&#8217;t have a tremendous number of products, you can <a href="https://zeracreative.com/ecommerce-website-development-services-pakistan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build your eCommerce store</a> on WordPress. In fact, it’s one of the best CRMs in terms of user-friendliness, posting, maintaining, and updating. And best for small to mid-sized.</p>
<p>Summing it up, stores that are huge with 100s of products are better hosted on other amazing WooCommerce alternatives (there’s a downside, discussed below). Whereas, WordPress’s WooCommerce is potent for websites that have a few products.</p>
<p>We have discussed the impact of size. And now let’s discuss an amazing Woocomerce alternative.</p>
<h2>Shopify VS WordPress Vs Magento for Ecommerce</h2>
<p>This’s one of the fierce debates. Some savvy marketers believe WordPress’s WooCommerce has more to offer, some believe Magento has amazing features for eCommerce, and some marketers vouch for Shopify, and believe Shopify has an edge over others.</p>
<p>In reality, all claims can be correct depending on your needs. Let’s compare together to elicit which one is better for your needs.</p>
<h3>Themes &amp; Plugins</h3>
<p>Shopify offers a classy set of well-designed templates. This means, that all their themes are professionally designed &#8211; even plugins come with no glitches. Whereas, the number of WordPress themes and plugins is second to none in terms of quantity. But can be hazardous to choose among the best. In simple terms, businesses with no or little technical knowledge can start a store on Shopify and pick a theme and plugins from the lot.</p>
<p>Whereas, businesses with budgets could start with WordPress + WooCommerce, providing they have the technical knowledge or have technical staff managing the store.</p>
<p>Last comes Magento, it doesn’t explicitly offer custom themes, so you’ve to rely on third-party tools for premium themes and you’ve to build ground up. So it requires prompt handling and technical knowledge to manage a site. Since it requires rigorous support, it could break your bank.</p>
<p>Based on where you’re in your business, and technical skills you can select what works best for you.</p>
<h3>Website Responsiveness</h3>
<p>All the themes and plugins on Shopify&#8217;s official website are responsive. This means, that all can adjust automatically across any device without looking botched up.</p>
<p>To select the best WordPress themes and plugins, you need to have knowledge–of which ones are responsive. Though, it’s easy to find out. Just do a google search; as you did to read this content. And you will have a lot of options before your eyes.</p>
<p>Same as WordPress, for Magento you require some knowledge about themes that would work for the kind of site you run. But because it&#8217;s a bit complex it could cost you more than the other options.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it’s always better to work with professionals like us who’ve been maintaining stores for years.</p>
<h3>Content Management</h3>
<p>Posting content on <a href="/eCommerce-website-development-services-pakistan/">eCommerce websites</a> is the best way to gain organic traction and sell more products. Providing, both Shopify and WordPress have amazing content management systems. Whereas, Magento doesn’t match the two on these premisses, rightly so; since it was developed by keeping product scalability in mind. However, you can manage content on Magneto.</p>
<p>In comparison, WordPress’s content management supersedes any other content management system by a country mile. As <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress captures</a> <strong>61.8% </strong>market share.</p>
<p>WordPress has content versioning—every single version of a pis age separately reserved/hold within a post or on a page and can replace/use or insert. Unfortunately, Shopify doesn’t have that luxury.</p>
<p>Next, WordPress allows setting different categories and tags flexibly when comparing with other options. That presents in a visually appealing and easily navigating way so anywho one lands on a website can easily navigate through.</p>
<p>For posting content—WordPress is the spearhead. But if we talk especially about product placing and management, both Shopify and Magento are intuitive and straightforward. The reason beithat ng, both are eCommerce dedicated SaaS solutions.</p>
<p>Plus, the option of <em>‘<strong>automated collections</strong>’</em> (Automated collections means you can use product titles, tags, price, etc. to create collections.) in both stores tie the competition among the two for an ultimate choice for companies with 100s of products.</p>
<h3>SEO for WordPress Vs Shopify</h3>
<p>For eCommerce business, SEO plays a huge part—essential to getting discovered organically. No business can always rely on Google Adwords or Facebook ads to generate traffic. At some point, every business wants organic traffic that sells its product.</p>
<p>Most WordPress themes and plugins are SEO-friendly and provide better optimization opportunities. However, to nail the SEO of your eCommerce stores hosted on WordPress, you need some key understanding of Meta descriptions, alt text, Product URL, page load speed, and much more.</p>
<p>Next, if you lack knowledge of SEO, then Shopify is a better option since most of the SEO functions are automated. But there’s a downside to it, you can’t create simple URL structures on Shopify.</p>
<p>Last, Magento offers optimization options for Google like it’s responsive (operating equally well across devices), user-friendly, and also feature-intensive (add as many features), but has issues with loading speed… And page speed contributes a lot to SEO.</p>
<h3>Blogging for Ecommerce</h3>
<p>We would want to discuss blogging separately from the above content management subhead because blogging is a marketing strategy to attract a lot of customers.</p>
<p>Blogging is by far one of the most tremendous ways to <a href="https://zeracreative.com/seo-company-pakistan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generate immense traffic on the website</a> and sell more products organically.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>When you create content besieging the product you sell &#8211; your customers see you as an authority and chances of organic selling increase. Because they’d believe that these guys have knowledge and authority over the subject &#8211; they’d consider buying.</p>
<p>Through blogging, we create funnels to sell products, and funnelling requires different strategies for unique products. So it’s a high-end strategy to convert prospects that land.</p>
<p>In light of the study, blogging prominence is unequivocal if you want to sell products on auto for your eCommerce business. And for this purpose, WordPress is the spearhead. It has some amazing features and supports content publishing and SEO.</p>
<p>Whereas, Shopify and Magento are super focused on product placement and automation. It’s safer to say that if selling through a blog is in your marketing mix, then WordPress can be the best option.</p>
<p>No, it didn’t say that Shopify and Magento do not support blogs and content. In fact, Magento is quite user-friendly and requires no technical knowledge to add posts. But WordPress has no substitute in this category, and it’s because WordPress is widely acknowledged as a CMS that supports blogging.</p>
<h3>Functionality Matters for Ecommerce Website</h3>
<p>Better functionality is the most preferable choice for <a href="https://www.designrush.com/agency/ecommerce/trends/ecommerce-solutions-small-businesses" target="_blank" title="eCommerce for small businesses" rel="noopener">eCommerce for small businesses</a>. WordPress, Magento, and Shopify provide better functionality. However, Shopify triumphs over WordPress in some ways. The reason is, that Shopify is an all-in solution for eCommerce stores, so it’s intuitive and easy to set up and offers everything you would need to kick-start the store and take it to the target audience.</p>
<p>About Magento, it beats both of them. Magento was developed with scalability in mind. You can have over 1000 products listed on Magento without much trouble – provided you have the correct technical support.</p>
<p>So for the functionality of huge stores – no comparison to Magento. Hands down. Next, Shopify can also be great for functionality, and you can operate it without much technical know-how. Whereas, WordPress does offer great functionality by using third-party integration tools such as WooCommerce.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, with additional lightweight plugins, you can make your store more functional.</p>
<p>The point is if you can afford to work with developers and want better, customized functionality of your store, then WordPress could be the choice. But if you don&#8217;t have a budget and are just starting out &#8211; Shopify is the answer.</p>
<h3>Security for E-commerce</h3>
<p>If your website is not secure, your business is at risk.</p>
<p>Providing that Shopify has better in-built security. It’s Shopify’s responsibility to provide you with a secure website. Once your business is set up, you’d not need to worry about cyber-attacks as Shopify has it covered for you.</p>
<p>Whereas, WordPress’s security is in your hands. It could be a negative point or a positive one. Since it’s in your hands, you can make it more secure and sturdy. But for that, you need to have knowledge about the best, glitch-free, and non-malicious code themes and plugins.</p>
<p>Besides, you’d need to keep checking on regular updates to avoid web crashing and give a smooth experience.<br />
Last, Magento is no different from WordPress. Since it&#8217;s open-source and one has to mostly rely on third-party tools. So the concern with Magento is the same as WordPress.</p>
<p>The point is, Shopify is secured to some extent; no doubt. But for WordPress and Magento you’d need to be proactive. Proactive means to keep a check on everything and anything to avoid security concerns. Alongside, you need to bout your store’s security by working with professionals like us who know how to ensure the security of a WordPress store.</p>
<p>Caveat: If you go with Shopify, you need to make sure you’d purchase templates directly from Shopify. Else, you could risk compromising website security.</p>
<h3>Does WordPress offer better integration for eCom stores?</h3>
<h3>Security for E-commerce</h3>
<p>Integration of a store with other 3rd party service providers is important to make the website function better. So it would give customers a better experience and give you (as a store owner) an advantage to customize it to your needs.</p>
<p>Shopify allows you to integrate a lot of cool tools that would make it easy to build a complete ecosystem – that handles everything from product placement to checkouts. Though Shopify is always the second guess integrating with other solutions and only allow integration when satisfied since they’re managing your website security all by themselves. This results in fewer integration options with 3rd party tools when compared with WordPress.</p>
<p>Whereas, Magento offers an enormous range of features that you could integrate with your store. 1000s of plugins and integration options are available. But, could get complicated for non-technical individuals and small store owners with moderate budgets.</p>
<p>Last, WordPress has a ton of integration options. More than enough for any business requirements. Since it doesn’t screen security, you’d need some knowledge about secure options. And with more options, you can further embellish your website</p>
<p>Better work with professionals who have knowledge about everything you need for a <a href="https://zeracreative.com/website-development-company-in-karachi-pakistan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sleek website</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>If Aesthetics is your main concern, go with WordPress all the way</h2>
<p>Have you ever purchased a product from a website that looks dull, mundane, and pale?</p>
<p>For an eCommerce store, aesthetics have remarkable weightage – without a doubt. It is right, as <a href="https://www.inc.com/logan-chierotti/harvard-professor-says-95-of-purchasing-decisions-are-subconscious.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customers buy on emotions</a> and later satisfy logic.</p>
<p>First, you have to win their heart, then prove to them the logic behind it. This’s the psychology of buying that comes in handy when making purchasing decisions.</p>
<p>This’s where WordPress chimes in and outshine. With the plethora of plugins and themes WordPress offers, you can create anything—anything means ANYTHING.</p>
<p>From the web layout to the colour combination, to the button placements, to the typography and literally everything. It gets fully customized and allows your product to stand out.</p>
<p>There’re a number of aspects that come in handy while selecting a platform to host a store. However, to sell the products and provide a seamlessly beautiful visual experience to your customers—you need WordPress + WooCommerce.<br />
There’s no better choice than this.</p>
<p>It doesn’t mean to negate Shopify or any other alternative options. All the other options offer some incredible themes and plugins and integration options. But none could get closer to WordPress due to high customization.</p>
<p>The point is, if you truly want to sell products, you need a visually appealing website that resonates with customers on so many levels. Then WordPress is the answer.</p>
<p>However, if you think aesthetics have nothing much to do with selling then you have a lot to choose from.</p>
<h2>Summing it up</h2>
<p>After a thorough study on the topic, it’s obvious that both WordPress and Shopify have benefits and drawbacks.<br />
Both are excellent choices &#8211; providing the need.</p>
<p>If you’re an up-and-coming eCommerce store owner and short on budget—you could go with Shopify. Or if you have 100s of products to lean with, Shopify is also a better choice, since it offers better automation and intuitive product placement experience.</p>
<p>And if you have a massive budget and have over 100s, or 1000s of products in your store, then you can consider Magento. The reason is, that you can get better customization over Shopify.</p>
<p>Whereas, if you have a moderate budget, not a huge list of products, and want to go all-in with marketing, aesthetics, and customization, WordPress is the ultimate choice. Not something you could consider, but a full and final option.</p>
<p>Before you leave the place, know that security is a huge concern and could sabotage your business in a matter of minutes if not catered to beforehand. So if you plan to go with WordPress, be sure you work with professionals, like us, who can handle website security, third-party tool integration, and website responsiveness.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The bottom line is, that WordPress is an ultimate choice due to its customization and Marketing benefits. Providing the technical side of things is handled by professionals like us. </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Design studios are hard to find, those that fulfill all your requirements. Sometimes, they have great testimonials but their portfolio might leave something to be said. Or they have great design concepts in their portfolio, but their testimonials are far and few between. But finding the right design studio that gives you great customer service as well as work, is like finding a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>If you are on the lookout for a design studio that helps you climb the ladder of success in the business world, it can be quite a lot of work. However, once that perfect studio is found, you, as a small start-up or business may have the potential to skyrocket in terms of growth.</p>

<p>Here are 5 steps to follow in order to find your dream design studio:</p>
<h2>1. Keep The End Goal in Mind</h2>
<p>When looking for a design studio, keep in mind the requirements of your business needs. What is your aim after hiring them? How will this studio propel your business’s success? Remember the end goal of hiring a design studio for your business; this could be something along the lines of</p>
<ul>
<li>Initiate a new type of brand advertising which will create greater recognition for the business as well as generate monthly revenue and profits</li>
<li>Using the help of rebranding to increase sales by 10-20%</li>
<li>Developing a customer-centric mobile app that works to build customer engagement</li>
<li>Enhance <a href="https://zeracreative.com/best-seo-company-in-karachi/">SEO</a> of your blog to increase the visibility of your website to the world</li>
</ul>
<p>When you have set these goals, it is important that you note the areas of expertise your shortlisted design studios offer. Do they offer the services that will help you to meet these goals? Do they have the right portfolio to support these services? How popular is its social media presence? Are their testimonials supporting their services as well?</p>
<p>Make sure while hiring the design studio, that it not only “looks good,” but it has to be more specific, detailed, and much more meaningful. Write down a few goals and check which agency provides the greatest potential and ability to help the business out.</p>
<h2>2. Get Inspired</h2>
<p>Find popular, well-known agencies and <a href="https://zeracreative.com/branding-logo-design-company-pakistan/">design studios</a> and sift through their work. Does it serve as an inspiration? Is it in line with what you want your business to look like, or is your <a href="https://zeracreative.com/wordpress-development-company/">website</a> or mobile app, branding, exactly in line with what you have in mind? Find a particular design, font, layout, logo, colors, and inspirational images that catch your eye and which depict the feel of what you want from your brand, etc.</p>
<p>The more specific you are with your choices and inspirational feel, the greater the possibility of finding the best-suited studio. You can always go to Pinterest to decide on your inspiration.</p>
<h2>3. Start Searching</h2>
<p>Once proper outlines have been made regarding finding the best studio, it’s time to start searching. Now, this may take some work. First, start with one’s inner circle and business colleagues. Ask around about who knows of a few design studios and whether they can help out with getting in touch with them. Next, try searching online. Although Google may have innumerable results for the words “design studio,” try putting in one’s location to narrow down and find specific, helpful results.</p>
<p>Check out their <a href="https://zeracreative.com/work/">portfolios</a> and websites, see what one likes and delve further into the details. Do they update their website frequently? Do they have good reviews from their clients?  Look at which businesses they’ve worked for in the past and how successful have they been in giving their clients what they want.</p>
<p>By going through all this effort, finding a design studio that identifies with the business’ beliefs, ideologies, and guarantees to deliver become much easier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=477687" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4223" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/58da17cf.jpg" alt="5 Steps to Follow to Hire a Great Design Studio for your Business - 58da17cf - Zera Creative" width="900" height="90" title="5 Steps to Follow to Hire a Great Design Studio for your Business 6"></a></p>
<h2>4. Make The First Move</h2>
<p>Once you’ve narrowed down which design studios suit the business the best, start contacting them. The most common and efficient method is by picking up the phone or e-mailing the agencies. If composing an e-mail, make it formal as well as precise and make sure to leave all of your contact details so they can reach back easily.</p>
<p>Try and contact as many studios as possible, so that if one doesn’t respond, another surely will. Give every agency a full week to reply back, just in case they are busy with other clients. Once the replies come in, pay close attention to which agency responds best and which one makes the best connection with you. Comparing responses helps to decide which studio is more invested in working with you.</p>
<h2>5. Cost Effective</h2>
<p>One very important factor involved in finding the best designer studio is to consider the costs. Make sure that the preferred studio and your business are on the same page when it comes to the cost of producing and designing through the studio.</p>
<p>If you are a small start-up then the best studio would be the one that works on a small scale in a more affordable manner. It is essential that the budget is discussed before finalizing which designer studio to choose from. This way, finding the best designer studio becomes a whole lot easier and more effective!</p>
<p>Overall, it can be said that finding the best design studio that suits one’s needs will take time and research. But once the dream studio is found, a lovely partnership blossoms, guaranteeing success and growth for both, the studio and the business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If your business has finally been able to muster the courage and venture into the ever-growing world of technology and mobile apps, today’s your lucky day! Before being able to hire the best studio to develop one’s dearly beloved app, it’s important to answer these 5 key questions to help one make the best of decisions.</p>
<p>The chance of one’s business skyrocketing to success is can only an app away! But first, here are some key questions to ask yourself before hiring an App Development Studio:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4737 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-scaled.jpg" alt="5 Questions You Need To Evaluate the Right App Development Studio - infographic 10 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1920" height="936" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-scaled.jpg 1920w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-300x146.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-1024x499.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-768x374.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-1536x748.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-2048x998.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-960x468.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-600x292.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-1313x640.jpg 1313w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-800x390.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" title="5 Questions You Need To Evaluate the Right App Development Studio 9"></p>
<h2>1. Are Their Portfolios of My Liking?</h2>
<p>Finding an App Development Studio that suits one’s requirements the best can be a lot of work as it involves skimming through various app development portfolios and searching for the most successful app developers.</p>
<p>However, if one sees something they like, it’s probably the first sign that this could be the potential “right” App Studio. Look through their portfolios, many of which can be found on their websites, and see whether their work fits with what one has in mind for their own future business’ app. Be observant of how much progress they have made in the past year and whether they specialize in the industry that one requires (e.g. Fitness, Social Media or Games).</p>
<p>Not only that, but check the reviews for their apps online at the <a href="https://www.google.com.pk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV24TCuazXAhUGqo8KHSGeDwQQFggjMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%3Fhl%3Den&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Yjl1oQSF0yePbWWRpp2jt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Store</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com.pk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV4cjMuazXAhUJpI8KHfppDPQQFggjMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fgenre%2Fios%2Fid36%3Fmt%3D8&amp;usg=AOvVaw34cC7wO8XCwshkhf59tXG3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AppStore</a>. Do their customers complain of bugs and lagging of the app? Have they made improvements to their app after all the complaints? How many stars have people given their apps? Do extensive research regarding what various studios have put out into the world of apps and how successful have they been?</p>
<p>If one likes what they see, this is an indication of having answered the first essential question before hiring an App Development studio.</p>
<h2>2. Who Are Their Past and Present Clients? Are They Satisfied?</h2>
<p>Take a look at who their clients were and currently are. Get in touch with them, contact this studio’s clients and don’t be afraid to ask. Get to know how their experience was. Was it amazing? Was it satisfactory or was it horrid? Ask them about the challenges they faced, how the studio dealt with them as a client and would they be open to working with this studio again?</p>
<p>By digging deep and finding out others’ hands-on experience, one will be able to get an idea of what it would be like to work with this particular studio. This is how the second question regarding hiring the dream app development studio is answered.</p>
<p>Not only will this help in narrowing one’s decision as to which studios to worth spending time on, but it will help give one a clear idea of what kind of experience as well as a response they require by hiring a particular studio.</p>
<h2>3. What Platform Are They Capable of Developing For?</h2>
<p>If one aims to make an app accessible to all customers and users, what is the best platform to make it available on? If one already has a platform in mind, does this particular App Development Studio allow the business to release an app on it? Getting to know if the studio has the ability to develop an app that is more suited for iOS or Android users? Will the app be available to users of all devices or just some? Will the app be available worldwide or only in the Pakistan?</p>
<p>These questions are important to ask as well as answer in order to hire a studio that is able to fulfill the technical requirements.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=477687" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4223" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/58da17cf.jpg" alt="5 Questions You Need To Evaluate the Right App Development Studio - 58da17cf - Zera Creative" width="900" height="90" title="5 Questions You Need To Evaluate the Right App Development Studio 10"></a></p>
<h2>4. How Much Time Will It Take?</h2>
<p>How long will one be willing to wait for their dream app to be made? And how long will the App Development Studio take? If there’s a deadline that needs to be met, will this trusted studio be able to make it in time? Be sure to ask how practical it is for this studio to be able to produce what you want in the amount of time specified by them. If this particular studio is not too sure about delivering what one requires, look to hire another studio that can promise an efficient, quick, and responsible service.</p>
<p>Also, evaluate if support is provided after the development work is completed. If the warranty period is missing, or if support and maintenance are not provided, then it is time to look for a studio that does.</p>
<p>Maintenance and support can help with changes, new feature addition, and any updates that may be required due to OS updates. Zera Creative provides up to <a href="https://zeracreative.com/monthly-website-maintenance-service-pakistan/">3 months of free maintenance support</a> post-delivery, after which it provides support and maintenance at reasonable rates.</p>
<h2>5. How Much Will It Cost? Is This Studio Budget-Friendly?</h2>
<p>Now, this is an important question to ask. A lot of the time, companies and studios can be very promising and successful; however, they can be way out of the business’ budget. It’s better to choose a small, affordable studio rather than hiring an over-the-top, expensive, popular studio that leaves one in debt.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is essential to ask oneself whether hiring this studio will allow one to still remain within their financial boundaries.</p>
<h2>6. Will The App Make Money? How Will The Profit Be Split?</h2>
<p>Another important thing to consider asking is if the mobile app makes revenue, how much will the Studio charge? Will there be a 50-50 split on profit? It is important to decide how much is to be charged for the development of the app so that a studio can be hired that is able to deliver as well as keep their promise of charging fairly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, it can be said that hiring the <a href="https://zeracreative.com">perfect App Development Studio</a> takes time, effort, and in-depth research about what one actually expects from the launch of a mobile application. Nevertheless, if one looks hard and long enough, they’ll find what they’re looking for.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Small businesses and blogs often struggle in building a great blog audience who loves to read their work and avail their products and services. Larger businesses often market through mainstream media like television, print, billboards, and activations. Smaller businesses and blogs struggle in promoting their actionable content and their services or products to their audience. That is when <a href="https://zeracreative.com/">social media</a> steps in. There are some key ways to promote your business and your blog without having to break the bank!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4739 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-scaled.jpg" alt="12 Ways To Leverage Social Media And Build Blog Audience! - infographic 11 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1920" height="1301" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-scaled.jpg 1594w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-300x203.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-1024x694.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-768x520.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-1536x1041.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-2048x1388.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-960x651.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-600x407.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-944x640.jpg 944w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-800x542.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" title="12 Ways To Leverage Social Media And Build Blog Audience! 12"></p>
<h2>Start Your Promotion From Home</h2>
<p>More often than not, blogs and businesses come up with great services, solutions, products, and content. But it keeps sitting on the shelves or websites waiting for someone to show up. Promotion of the brand, however, starts from home. Bring out your social media profiles, and actively promote your services and posts with your friends and family. If they are part of the audience profile you came up with, then these are the first step towards building a blog audience. Even though sometimes, they may not share the same view of how great your brand is, or could be, building numbers on your blog, product or service, can help build a better word of mouth.</p>
<h2>Work On Your Personal Profile</h2>
<p>Build and perfect your own personal profile first. Share your business profile URLs within your own profile, populate your about us section with key details of your business, and mention the kind of products and services you offer. Your personal profile should be a visual landscape of your business so that people can relate you to your business easily. Even if you do not portray yourself as a brand or a person behind your brand, you can still mark the products and services on your personal profile, to denote your support for them. Promote key elements of your business and your blog on your personal profile to indicate your support as well.</p>
<h2>Start Building A Network</h2>
<p>Building a network online and offline can be key in generating leads, building a blog audience, and promoting your brand to your target audiences. Networking can help with recall as people start recognizing the brand. This brand recall can become stronger the more you participate online as well as offline in the communities where your target audiences are found. For example, there are several groups on LinkedIn, Facebook and communities across different forums where your target audiences may hang out. Work to build a strong network in these communities, by helping answer queries, talking to people in general, and communicating with the audiences.</p>
<h2>Participate In All The Right Places</h2>
<p>While networking would indicate hanging out where your audiences are, and getting to know them. Participation would often involve you to be in places that your audiences would be. For example, if your audience profile is such that they would be found amongst social media channels such as LinkedIn and Snapchat that most businesses never think about, then, by all means, participate and use these channels.  If you are actively participating in channels that are the right fit with your blog audience, then you can continue to reap benefits as more visitors come on to your website.</p>
<h2>Engage With Your Target Audience</h2>
<p>While engagement and networking on social media platforms will bring you most of your audience, you should also consider engaging with your target blog audience on other platforms and forums. Social Media is one key to the larger scheme of finding and collecting audience. Another key is finding the audience on forums and communities where engagement can be done through answering questions, posting questions, and sharing anecdotes and stories. With this engagement, your net worth is built and your expertise is highlighted. Quora is a general forum where all sort of audience is found. You can conduct a basic Google Search to find communities that resonate with your brand, to find more audiences there.</p>
<h2>Claim Your Name</h2>
<p>While social media can be a great audience builder, a key tip that most entrepreneurs fail to realize is that your name should be standard across all platforms. This includes your domain name, your social media channel names across different mediums, and your profiles. A singular name can help in finding your social media pages/profiles quickly rather than having to hunt through them. This can build familiarity amongst your audience for an easier transition from your social media page or profile to your website.</p>
<h2>Get Yourself Published</h2>
<p>Most small businesses have found their audiences and claim to fame, through getting published in larger publications. If you prefer to have your name out there amongst your key visitors, then aim to get published. Some key publications that take in articles from various bloggers and businesses include Huffington Post, Forbes, Inc.com, BuzzFeed, and more. You should also use mediums such as LinkedIn and Medium to build your and your brand&#8217;s online presence. It helps when a person searches out on the search engine and comes across details that build your online presence and display you as an expert or a knowledge leader in your field.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Forget Local Networking</h2>
<p>While most businesses work on building a seamless <a href="https://zeracreative.com/">social media</a> presence, local networking is often forgotten. A lot of your audience can come directly from word of mouth. Find out local networking groups, volunteering options, churches, and meetups that you can go to. These have people who are generally going to be like-minded. They will be more in tune based on the kind of audience profile you have created. These audiences can be a great boost in terms of word of mouth for your business as well as your blog.</p>
<h2>Get Your Business Cards Out</h2>
<p>Business cards are often the least used item in a small business or blog. But they can bring about a great boost to your blog if used in the right manner. A business card generally should contain social media channel IDs as well for the receiver to relate to your social media presence. Business cards can help you connect with your audience. They are a great help in brand recall when the receiver views the card again. Both physical and digital business cards can help in this case.</p>
<h2>Get Your Audience To Share</h2>
<p>Once your audience is visiting your blog or your website, the next step is to add options that allow your audience to share your goodness with the world. If you use a WordPress website, there are some key plugins that allow you to create toolbars for social media sharing. Similarly, for other websites built on other platforms, you can build social media sharing toolbars that allow your audience to share your posts, products or services on their profiles.</p>
<h2>Add Click to Tweet Options</h2>
<p>A key trick that quite a few blogs have used recently for good measure is the <a href="https://clicktotweet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click to Tweet</a> Option. You can also build this feature in your blog through plugins and codes. A specific phrase or sentence can be converted into a tweet and embedded into your content. The audience can readily share that piece on their Twitter profile by clicking on the Click To Tweet button. This way, your content is shared with the world, without significant effort from the audience itself. You can leverage social media profiles of your readers to get more audience onto your website this way.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Forget Lesser Used Channels</h2>
<p>More often than not, you can find your blog audience on social media channels that you may personally not be using. For example, some audience may be available on Pinterest, Instagram, Snapchat and LinkedIn. Usually, we may use these channels as a user but not as a small business owner or a blogger. However, these are great hubs to find great audience profiles and build your <a href="https://zeracreative.com/">social media</a> presence. For example, Pinterest is a key tool that a lot of people use to search for relevant content. You can leverage this idea by promoting your products, services and blog posts directly to your blog audience, on Pinterest boards for people to find, share and redirect to your <a href="https://zeracreative.com/">website</a>!</p>

<p>We live in a world that is dominated by technology. The things we see, the work we do, and the way we interact with the things around us, are all impacted by technology. On one hand, where this huge inheritance of innovation is making lives more convenient, it is also opening up a higher level of clutter amongst organizations that revolve their businesses around these technologies.</p>
<p>The most recent innovation that is sweeping every industry off its feet is <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artificial Intelligence</a></strong>. While it has a been a while since AI made its arrival; it is now that every industry is actually embracing its potential.</p>
<p>Amongst all, the one industry that has one of the most customer-centric workings is E-Commerce. Many e-commerce businesses have already inculcated Artificial Intelligence in their organizations and are catering to better results.</p>
<p>In this blog, we have covered the influence of <strong>AI on e-commerce businesses</strong>, and the different ways in which organizations use it.</p>
<h2><strong>Defining the Concept of Artificial Intelligence</strong></h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence demonstrates the machines that are intelligent and capable enough to perform tasks and function on their own. The machines that assimilate AI are designed in a way that they can think and behave like a human.</p>
<p>This capability has given a rise to businesses in choosing to integrate with Artificial Intelligence, in order to enhance their overall efficiency and productivity. Over the years, the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/607716/worldwide-artificial-intelligence-market-revenues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">market for AI has seen a tremendous rise</a>; in 2016, the global market of AI was approximately worth 3,221 billion US dollars. As of 2025, it will reach approximately 89,847 billion US dollars.</p>

<h2><strong>Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>In the current scenario of the market where AI is bringing forth a lot of opportunities, being innovative is the key to success. The importance that this technology is getting has edged marketers to integrate AI into their business.</p>
<p>Following are some of the most common techniques in which <a href="/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>app development companies</strong></a> are making use of AI.</p>
<h3><strong>Using Chatbots</strong>:</h3>
<p>Over the years, there has been a rapid shift in the focus of businesses in regard to the users. Initially, it stood at catering to a bigger market, but it has now come to generate a great experience for the users. Many retailers have taken a better understanding of Artificial Intelligence and are incorporating techniques like Chatbots to improve the experience of users.</p>
<p>Now, what exactly is a Chatbot? In the most basic terms, a bot is a computer program that has been developed in a way that it indulges in conversations with the users in a completely human-like manner.</p>
<p>Big brands like H&amp;M, Amazon &amp; Walmart completely depend on chatbots for answering to the queries of the customers. Because the bots answer in a very conversational way (even though they are supposed to be mechanical), they have been gaining a lot of popularity. So much, so that when a user talks to the bot, it creates an illusion that a human is answering the queries!</p>
<p>Also, bots give very instant responses, eliminating the chances of users having to wait for a long period of time.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1933 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hm-chatbot.png" alt="How is Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce? - hm chatbot - Zera Creative" width="750" height="332" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hm-chatbot.png 750w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hm-chatbot-300x133.png 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hm-chatbot-600x266.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" title="How is Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce? 21"></p>
<p>Chatbots are connected with Artificial Intelligence and are hence trained to answer questions in the most relevant manner. It understands and learns from the interactions it has with users, stores them, and uses them to give answers in the future.</p>
<p>The best part about bots is that it not only improve the experience of users on the app, it is also increasing the productivity of the organization. Bots are efficiently saving the time of the employee who otherwise would have been delegated to respond to these queries of users!</p>
<h3><strong>Managing the inventory in organizations</strong>:</h3>
<p>The constant pain that employees face is keeping a track of everything in an organization. Be it as small as a pin, you will have to keep the inventory up to date. The predictive nature of Artificial Intelligence has taken care of managing the inventory!</p>
<p>Based on the working of AI, it collects and analyses the important factors that drive the demand for major requirements in the market, predicts what their future demands would be, and that gives the organizations a benefit in knowing their inventory needs!</p>
<h3><strong>Easier customer searches:</strong></h3>
<p>If we look at it from the perspective of the users, it is very difficult to find the exact thing that you are looking for. Of course, users can spend hours on search engines trying to find what they are looking for, but the chances of coming across that exact thing are slight.</p>
<p>Thanks to the tech-friendly world we are living in, Artificial Intelligence has the perfect solution for this! AI assists the customers in finding what they were looking for in a much more natural way.</p>
<p>Take for instance, in the app <a href="https://www.gofind.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go Find</a>, you can take a picture of whatever you like. The app will bring similar-looking results from its stores.</p>
<p>The Echo Look by Amazon uses a camera integrated with Artificial Intelligence. It gives recommendations about what looks best on the user!</p>
<p>The whole concept of AI is eliminating the need for typing search words to look for something. It is now shifting to using visuals to complete that task, making the process more interesting.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1936 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/artificial-intelligence-impacting-e-commerce-go-find-visual-fashion-search.jpg" alt="How is Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce? - artificial intelligence impacting e commerce go find visual fashion search - Zera Creative" width="750" height="320" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/artificial-intelligence-impacting-e-commerce-go-find-visual-fashion-search.jpg 750w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/artificial-intelligence-impacting-e-commerce-go-find-visual-fashion-search-300x128.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/artificial-intelligence-impacting-e-commerce-go-find-visual-fashion-search-600x256.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" title="How is Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce? 22"></p>
<h3><strong>Create an interactive sales process</strong>:</h3>
<p>Given the high level of competition in every domain today, it is pretty difficult to reach out to the customers and offer them the most appropriate services. Which is why the integration of Artificial Intelligence in managing the customers’ time efficiently. It understands the choices of the users before providing any customized solutions.</p>
<p>Also, it deploys the time of the users only in the areas required. It also ensures that they don’t see any inappropriate products. For instance, The North Face uses “IBM Watson”. It asks the users choice-related questions like “Where will you be using the jacket?”. Based on the answers, it brings forth the most relevant products.</p>
<h3><strong>Channeling a new level of personalization</strong>:</h3>
<p>Regardless of who the user is or what they want, they would want a personalized experience on the app. Rather than generalizing the needs of the users, the algorithms of Artificial Intelligence can be utilized to cater the personalized content for the users. That would give them a better and more optimized experience.</p>
<p>This can be illustrated by an example; suppose a user is browsing for a superhero tee on a website from their laptop. Now, they can receive advertisements about any offers or sales related to that search when they open any social media platform (eg. Facebook, Instagram) from their mobile phone as well.</p>

<h3><strong>Virtual assistants</strong>:</h3>
<p>Being a part of the tech world has accustomed us to expect a higher level of convenience with every new technology that envelopes us. The concept of Virtual Assistants like Siri &amp; Alexa has opened up new opportunities for users.</p>
<p>They are already impacting the way users do their purchasing. By helping out in practically every task that users perform on a website or app, virtual assistants have made e-commerce a successful domain.</p>
<p>Right from navigating the users from one location on the app to another, to finding something for them, to placing their order, the integration of virtual assistants has reached the next level!</p>
