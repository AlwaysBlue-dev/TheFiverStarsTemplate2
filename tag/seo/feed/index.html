										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It doesn’t matter how thorough and well-researched your content is, if it cannot follow On-Page SEO guidelines, it would never disrupt fierce competition. And, would never see limelight aka cement top places on SERPs.</p>
<p>Heck, not even be read by the target audience as the content pieces would be far away from page 1 … and as a result, your content would keep on piling up dust and nothing else.</p>
<p>That’s why no website can afford to not implement On-Page SEO tactics that pronounce its authority to search engines. So search engines could rank it better than competitors and show it to the mass audience.</p>
<p>This article intends to dispense some highly valuable On-Page SEO strategies that will help better your rankings. The strategies we’re going to show you are quite useful that even <a title="SEO gurus in Pakistan" href="https://zeracreative.com/seo-company-pakistan/">SEO gurus</a> would hoard from you so they can sell their course…</p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s get into the nuts and bolts…</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4743 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-scaled.jpg" alt="Secrets to Nail On-Page SEO (That SEO Gurus Won’t Tell) - infographic 13 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1594" height="1080" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-scaled.jpg 1594w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-300x203.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-1024x694.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-768x520.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-1536x1041.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-2048x1388.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-960x651.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-600x407.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-944x640.jpg 944w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-800x542.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1594px) 100vw, 1594px" title="Secrets to Nail On-Page SEO (That SEO Gurus Won’t Tell) 4"></p>
<h2>Snippet Optimization</h2>
<p>In 2022 snippet optimization is HUGE.</p>
<p>No blog should be without snippet optimization because regardless of your position in Google SERPs … Google shows your content on top of every other content for a particular keyword if it was optimized for that keyword.</p>
<p>What it means, you gain Zero Position on Google SERPs well above any ranked website, if you optimized snippets better than them. Isn’t it fascinating?</p>
<p>There are two ways to do so,</p>
<p><strong>1. Write a helpful answer paragraph that gives a quick solution to the readers.</strong></p>
<p>Since Google values its users, it would pick up on the on-point answer as a standalone so users don’t have to wrap their heads around it to get the answer.</p>
<p>And if users want to go in-depth to understand the base of your answer, they can open the link and read it through. It’s so huge that now every single company that understands Google&#8217;s algorithm and criticality to win Zero Position is now focusing on optimizing snippets that show in the Google search.</p>
<p><strong>2.HTML headings are another way to win snippet competition, provided that the headings are relevant to the search query.</strong></p>
<p>Google picks up on these when a paragraph isn’t enough to answer the search query. Like “7 Methods to perform SEO research” or “How to set up your WordPress website” Logically speaking, it would be impossible for a blog creator to cram everything into a single paragraph.</p>
<p>Also, Google knows that the answer to such questions must be thorough, and step by step like a process. So your content must have relevant HTML Headings to be picked by Google as featured snippets.</p>
<p>However, there is other critical and technical info related to snippet optimization like, when to write an answer so Google can pick it up easily, what should be the length of the answer and where to place it in the text body.</p>
<p>To nail it with perfection, you can <a href="/contact">get back to us and we will hook you up</a>.</p>
<h2>Content Relevance Reigns Supreme</h2>
<p>Gone are the days when bloggers would stuff keywords throughout the content to fake search engines and acquire top most places. Now Google and their AI got advanced enough that they no longer facilitate such shady practices of ranking content.</p>
<p>So to rank the content above competitors, the content must have relevance and solve customer queries. We can’t emphasize enough on this.</p>
<p>Google now has changed a fair fit that it only allows genuine content creators that come up with unique content that ticks with readers to rule the SERPs.</p>
<p>The result of this advancement favours top content creators that cater to the relevance and buckle down those content creators that only produce the rehashed version of what’s already been on the web.</p>
<p>So for you to outrank competitors, it’s fantastically critical to producing genuine content that intends to solve readers’ problems. If you satisfy the reader to the core and make them stick around till the end, Google will pick this up and boost your rankings.</p>
<h2>Internal Linking for SEO Optimization</h2>
<p>Internal linking passes on link juice to all the content it’s linked to. This’s a bit technical but would benefit you a lot. Let’s make it simple for you…</p>
<p>OK! So you have a few content pieces that attract eyeballs for all the good reasons and generate a heck of load lot of traffic. But you figure out that the other content pieces aren’t getting as meaningful results as much as you’d hoped for.</p>
<p>In this case, you can link the already ranked posts to the other low-performed posts. That helps pass on a bit of credibility to low-performing posts. Isn&#8217;t it amazing?</p>
<p>Oh… and should I tell you another heck? When companies create a product page/service page they include links to the top-performing content that redirect to that product page.</p>
<p>Which helps them gain link juice and helps improve its overall ranking. Companies keep generating content around the service/product page for that same matter.</p>
<p>However, the relevance of the surrounding contents determines the performance of the directed page. That is the easiest way to improve rankings of your non-performing content by linking to it from high-performing content.</p>
<h2>Outbound Links for On-Page Optimization</h2>
<p>Outbound links are the links that you plug into your content pieces that direct to the authoritative websites.</p>
<p>Websites that have high <a title="Domain Authority (DA) and high Page Authority (PA)" href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/domain-authority" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Domain Authority (DA) and high Page Authority (PA)</a>. These links are vital for Web crawlers to adjudge your content’s authority.</p>
<p>What it means, when you link to credible resources to back up your claims, Google crawlers will follow it and pass on the signal of authority. By authority means, the content you put on is backed up by authoritative data, which increases the legitimacy of your claims.</p>
<p>So, the websites could be Government owned like. .gov or Institutional owned like PubMed etc. So, in the nerve-wracking and palm-sweating competition, outbound links play their vital role.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, finding websites that improve your authority over time is a daunting process and can eat up your time and energy…<br />
The best plot is to <a href="/contact">let us assist you</a> in doing the whole darn thing.</p>
<h2>White Spacing</h2>
<p>You have read it this far… Why? Because you’ve found the content <em>palatable</em>.</p>
<p>If we cramped the whole darn concept without spacing or putting up headings, and breaking up sentences, you wouldn’t mind shutting down the content before reading a single paragraph, let alone read it this far.</p>
<p>What that says is always make use of white spacing (though don’t overdo that). White spacing isn&#8217;t rocket science, simply break up sentences and paragraphs into one or 2 lines.</p>
<p>So the readers feel at ease reading the content without giving themselves a headache. I got it, but what does it have to do with Page SEO?</p>
<p>Smart question! If your readers bounced off without reading till the end, Google picks up on that and terms your content not worthy to the readers. Consequently, Google will push your content down in the rankings.</p>
<p>So white spacing to give breathers to the readers’ eyes is an extremely useful strategy to boost rankings.</p>
<h2>Optimized Images</h2>
<p>Never make the banal mistake of not optimizing images. The ALT text you write for images is picked up by Google, which further propounds to Google what the content is about. The secret to writing ALT text is to write short, punchy, to the point, yet effective and meaningful text.</p>
<p>Text that gives off the exact meanings that you want to convey through your content. The text could be termed as the sum up the context of what you want to portray through content.</p>
<p>The point is always to make sure to optimize images with text that could help boost rankings.</p>
<h2>URL Optimization</h2>
<p>Make sure that the URL link must not as long as your title. And just focus on conveying the gist of the matter in two to three words. For example, for content heading like “7 methods to perform content audit”, the URL mustn’t be this long.</p>
<p>It should be something like www.yourwebsitename.com/content-audit</p>
<p>It helps in two ways; you make it simple for Google to understand what the content is about in less space. Second, you might want to expand your content to 11 methods or could be 21 methods; so you don’t always change the URL.</p>
<p>Since it probably is linked to other resources, and doing so generates 404 errors. You would want to avoid that as it’s not fruitful for your rankings.</p>
<h2>Wrap Up</h2>
<p>Now you’ve learned masterful tricks on how to perform On-Page SEO and jack up your chances to boost organic rankings.</p>
<p>The next thing you need to do is implement them to the tee. Which is a bit of a tedious process if you haven’t done it before. Plus, it might overwhelm you since you already have too much on your plate to handle.</p>
<p>In which case, you can <a href="https://zeracreative.com/best-seo-company-in-karachi/">reach us out</a> and we’ll be happy to assist. However, if you decide to implement them on your own, make sure to cater to all the above tricks to nail on-page SEO.</p>

<p>1. Positioning Through Visibility</h2>
<p>Business is all about <em>positioning</em>.</p>
<p>If you’re one up in a position to your target audience, you can mint far more dollars and authority over them. Whereas, if you reach them out, you hand over that positioning prowess to them.</p>
<p>We know it’s a bit of a “wrapping head around” concept, but hold tight we will walk you through it… Positioning in terms of SEO means is, when we create content based on customers&#8217; problems, we position ourselves as those who will help them out.</p>
<p>Those who’re solving problems while asking nothing for it at first. This gives you a massive positioning edge, and if you continuously produce content that steers them to your solution.</p>
<p>Voila! You have a secret to their heart and their sacred money… But, hey! This isn’t that easier than you might think.</p>
<p>To really get benefit from a position through SEO, you MUST gain top Google places for most keywords that journey your customers to your offer.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.zerolimitweb.com/organic-vs-ppc-2021-ctr-results-best-practices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">71.33% clicks happen</a> on the first page of Google for any search term.</p>
<p>If you don’t know how to secure top places, you can reach us and we’re happy to <a href="/contact">assist</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Web Traffic Without Banking On Ads</h2>
<p>As we all know that paid ads can take a toll on your budget and squeeze it out, if the targeting wasn’t on point, or the message wasn’t as effective.</p>
<p>There are other crucial tricks of the trades that also need to be considered for running paid campaigns. Relying totally on them is a Nah! Nah! strategy.</p>
<p>And as we touched on earlier, reaching them out by targeting them instead of them reaching you out is a low-position, low-status strategy…<br />
Point is, to generate a stable business where customers could come and knock on your door while you sleep day in and day out &#8212; SEO would be your best bet.</p>
<p>No! We aren’t against paid marketing…</p>
<p>In fact, we are huge proponents of that. But what you need to understand is, Paid ads can help you acquire leads in days, though you can’t always bank on Paid ads due to certain complications and always the risk of losing money.</p>
<p>Plus, here you’re reaching them out, &#8212; remember positioning?</p>
<h2>3. Improves Trustworthiness</h2>
<p>Where their money is involved, there is some sure doubt. Doubt could be related to anything…</p>
<p>Optimizing your content is a wonderful way to subdue any doubts. Let’s understand this concept with a scenario, when your customers want to do business with you, especially if big bucks are involved, they would definitely run a Google search.</p>
<p>To see what you’re up to… This is something you might have done as well… Haven’t you?</p>
<p>When you optimize your website or online business for search engines, your customers will deem you worthy as a lot would pop up when they search.</p>
<p>Also, when they go through the content you’ve created, it further plants a seed in their heads of trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Which would give you a massive positioning edge… Not only will your customers shoot to work with you, but also they’d be willing to pay you the premium.</p>
<h2>4. Can Sell To Customers Using Targeted Keywords</h2>
<p>Did you know <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/87-of-shoppers-now-begin-product-searches-online/530139/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">87% of shoppers</a> find products through online search?</p>
<p>Not 10, 20, or 50… It’s 87%! What it illustrates is if businesses don’t optimize their websites for search engines, they leave an enormous sum of money on the table. What about those who optimize? Well, they’re having a ball… Simple as that.</p>
<p>Here’s your opportunity to craft content around keywords that your audience is searching for so you can nudge your target audience towards a solution. (Whisper* your solution). We can’t emphasize enough on this. Again it boils down to <em>positioning</em>. (Ugh, yet again…)</p>
<p>The more you show up for keywords your target audience is searching for, the better positioning you’ll have that you can leverage to sell them. You can search out what keywords your target market is mostly searching for and create content around it. Isn&#8217;t it awesome? BTW, winning top search engine places in the neck-to-neck online competition is a ferocious task that requires a heck load of work and an understanding of certain strategies.</p>
<p>If you stuck to this, who would focus on scaling the business? Amidst of all this, you can reach us out and we’ll help you <a href="https://zeracreative.com/seo-company-pakistan/">rank your website higher in google search</a>.</p>
<h2>5. SEO for Better User Experience UI</h2>
<p>A website that follows good SEO practices always gives off a better user experience. Let us explain this to you, people consider those two aspects separate, however, they are as interlinked as online business and internet connection.</p>
<p>Without an internet connection, online business is nothing but a mere dream and vice versa. Same as, aesthetics and clear navigations are important both for user experience to flip pages and pace around without much problem and for SEO… Without optimizing website aesthetics and ensuring sleek navigations Google will deduct SEO points. Since navigation tells Google what the content is about, and in which category it lies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=477687" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4223" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/58da17cf.jpg" alt="7 Reasons Why SEO is necessary for Your Online Business - 58da17cf - Zera Creative" width="900" height="90" title="7 Reasons Why SEO is necessary for Your Online Business 8"></a></p>
<p>And aesthetics make it easy for users to stay around for long. The point being SEO and UI go hand in hand. Let’s understand this with another example, take page speed and Mobile friendliness for the matter of discussion… <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/mobile-page-speed-google-rankings-user-experience/234739/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Page speed and mobile friendliness</a> are two important aspects of user experience.</p>
<p>Without a responsive and fast site, a website would always repel users. Since it repels users, it’s bad for SEO. And because of these two reasons Google deems content unworthy and relegates it below competitors. The point is for a good website it must have proper integration of SEO and UI.</p>
<h2>6. Market Knowledge</h2>
<p>SEO helps understand what’s working in the industry. The more you bank on SEO, the more you remain on top of the trends. What it means, to stay competitive in your industry on Google SERPs, you must know what are the latest updates in your industry.</p>
<p>Upon knowing, create content around the hot topics. Because if you don’t your competitors will. And that’s not a good place to be in. Right?</p>
<p><strong>Staying up to date with the trends has two benefits:,</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>You can turn a lot of visitors to your website by leveraging the power of currently in-demand or top-of-the-head topics that your target audience is searching for.<br />
<strong>B: </strong>Based on what’s currently working, you can predict the forthcoming trends and make your strategy regarding it beforehand.</p>
<p>This is the easiest way to hack your way to profits.</p>
<h2>7. Long-Term Strategy That Pays Dividends</h2>
<p>We said it before, and we are saying it again. SEO is not flipping your fingers to get clients&#8217; strategy… It’s a long arduous strategy that initially won’t add much to your bottom line, but 6 months later, or a year later you’d witness some changes.</p>
<p>More inbound leads are coming to fill out the form to work with you or buy your product. Provided that your website is properly optimized on the latest Google guidelines. If it’s, congratulations, you’re about to take off and make huge leaps in your business.</p>
<h2>Wrap Up</h2>
<p>This post enlightens you about the effectiveness of SEO for online businesses. For businesses that intend to flourish and generate organic and inbound leads while they sleep, then there’s no better strategy than doing proper SEO of your website.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that it takes time to pick up the momentum and win Google&#8217;s trust. Are you ready to run a marathon?</p>
<p>Anyway, if you are unsure of the process, &#8212; don’t &#8212; just don’t, we’ll take care of it. If you <a href="/contact">head to us</a>, we ensure we do proper <a href="https://zeracreative.com/best-seo-company-in-karachi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO of your website</a> that beats competitors over time and win you organic leads.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As people of the twenty-first century, whenever we require more information on something, our first instinct is to look it up on the internet with the help of a search engine. Chances are that almost always 4 out of 5 people will click on the website that shows up first. If one is keen on taking their website to the next level, SEO may be just the genie-in-lamp you are looking for!</p>
<p>In order to increase your website’s chances of being frequently clicked on and visited, knowing and applying the concepts of SEO or search engine optimization, is essential.</p>
<h2>So, what is SEO?</h2>
<p>It stands for Search Engine Optimization, a metaphoric rulebook for companies/website owners to follow in order to help increase their website’s ranking on any search engine.</p>
<h2>Why is it so important?</h2>
<p>In very basic terms, SEO will only benefit the website itself, making it more accessible, available, user-friendly and trustworthy.</p>
<p>Nowadays, using search engines has become second nature to us. Millions of users take the help of results offered by these engines such as Google and Bing in order to find information. School work, news reports and almost everything that is available online are found through search engines.</p>
<p>So, let us see how you can improve your website’s SEO:</p>
<h2>1. Not Another Trust-Building Exercise!</h2>
<p>SEO is significant because it helps internet users become familiar with one’s website and eventually learn to trust the results it produces. If one’s website shows up more often on the first page of results, chances are more people get to see the website, click on it and if satisfied, build a reliance on the website regarding their experience. This way the website helps gather visitors, customers, and clients with the help of SEO by building trust.</p>
<h2>2. First Search, Then Share!</h2>
<p>Build and perfect your own personal profile first. Share your business profile URLs within your own profile, populate your about section with key details of your business, and mention the kind of products and services you offer. Your personal profile should be a visual landscape of your business so that people can relate to your business easily.</p>
<p>Even if you do not portray yourself as a brand or a person behind your brand, you can still mark the products and services on your personal profile, to denote your support for them. Promote key elements of your business and your blog on your personal profile to indicate your support as well.</p>
<h2>3. First Place</h2>
<p>If more than one website is selling or promoting the same thing, websites with search engine optimization are more likely to grab the attention of customers and viewers who will see the website show up in the first few results. This way cut-throat competition between websites can be won with the help of SEO.</p>
<h2>4. Cost-Effective</h2>
<p>SEO is especially important for small-sized businesses that are looking to advertise themselves without going way over their allocated budget. It allows one to do cost-effective marketing through search engines. If you have a budget, you can always use keywords to promote your website through advertisements thus increasing your chances of visibility in the search results. This way, the SEO helps to create an online presence through the website’s frequent appearance on search engine results.</p>
<p>Just realize that a <a href="https://www.webfx.com/seo/learn/seo-friendly-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search engine optimized website</a> has twice the advantage compared to a website that is not. Therefore, choosing to apply SEO principles to one’s websites may just be the fuel required to help the company’s spaceship to skyrocket!</p>
<p><strong>Here are a few key steps in order to build a great SEO for one’s website:</strong></p>
<h3>SEO Tip #1:</h3>
<p>It’s all about the title! Make sure that every blog post/article posted on the website contains an eye-catching title that includes certain specific keywords that when searched for, show up in the first few results because they are included in the article. For SEO that is specific to a country, refer to cities and use indigenous terms that make the title of the article more relevant in order to show up first.</p>
<h3>SEO Tip #2:</h3>
<p>Along with that, use keywords frequently within the post as well, preferably in the first paragraph to build good SEO for the website. The more common terms, phrases, and keywords used that people tend to search for, the greater the foundation for fantastic search engine optimization! To do that, use keyword research tools that can help you find good keywords to use. Also, try using long-tail keywords that are longer phrases that people use to search on search engines.</p>
<h3>SEO Tip #3:</h3>
<p>Link it up! Make sure to provide users on the website, with suggestions for other articles and blog posts related to the searched article. This way it allows users to keep up to date with new and old posts that they might be interested in checking out. With interconnected links or internal link building, you have better chances of improving your website’s SEO over time. Same goes for external link building through social media submissions, publishing articles and news items that have your <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/url" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website’s URLs</a>, and directory submissions.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Overall, it can be said that building good SEO takes time but it pays off in the end. For beginners, it is a new venture into the big sea of business advances. However, good SEO may just be the best way to garner attention from internet users and eventually build clients!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you started a new business or a company? That means you definitely got a website and trying to get visibility in search engines. In the current day and age, it has been a tough task for a business or website owner to get visibility in search engines. Do not worry; you could still get a decent presence in the search engines as a Startup company or business. But, you need to apply a few SEO techniques to your startup company website.</p>
<p>SEO or search engine optimization is an essential element required to get website visibility in search engine result pages (SERPs). For instance, you got a ‘health management tips’ website and want your website to show up at the top of the search results when a user types ‘health management tips’ in the search box. As a result, your website would get an influx of new traffic and a potential audience.</p>
<p>But, to get the display in the top search results, you need to sail through ranking factors that are set by the search engines to determine your website visibility in the search results. Nevertheless, start applying the basic SEO techniques to your site and once you are used to them and feel comfortable, you could learn new SEO techniques and apply them to your Startup Company or business website.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4741 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-12-scaled.jpg" alt="4 Simple SEO Techniques For Startups - infographic 12 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1920" height="1898" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-12-scaled.jpg 1093w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-12-300x297.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-12-1024x1012.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-12-768x759.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-12-1536x1518.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-12-2048x2024.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-12-960x949.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-12-600x593.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-12-648x640.jpg 648w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-12-800x791.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" title="4 Simple SEO Techniques For Startups 10"></p>
<h2>1. Create a Website That Could Be Indexed</h2>
<p>This is the utmost and most important thing in SEO. Hence, create a website that could be indexed by search engines, because the search engines run automated programs called ‘spiders’ in between internal and external links of a website in storing database known as ‘Index’. This makes the search engines show up the website results in search results, whenever a user enters a search query.</p>
<h2>2. Keyword Research</h2>
<p>You need to know that the search results for a query appear based on the keywords, thus making the SEO dependent on finding out the ‘Keywords’. In the <a href="https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2012/07/23/a-6-step-process-for-keyword-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">process of  Keyword Research</a>, you have to concentrate on both branded and industry keywords both as well. Industry keywords comprise generic queries such as ‘Software Applications’ and ‘Online Training’, while ‘Brand Keywords’ comprise the phrases around the name and URL of your company.</p>
<p>However, while determining the keywords for your business or company website, you need to determine them based on the metrics like Search Volume in a Month Competition Levels (Other Website Pages for a particular query) and the mission of your website (Website Relevant). These factors give you a list of keywords, out of which you have to shortlist 5 to 10 targeted keywords for your <a href="https://zeracreative.com/website-development-company-in-karachi-pakistan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">startup website</a>.</p>
<h2>3. Quality Content</h2>
<p>Using the finalized keywords, you need to create potential and quality content on your website. Because the more content you have on your website the more chances you get to rank high for various keywords in search results. Besides, the visitors will share your content amongst them if it is really good enough that creates brand recognition for your company.</p>
<h2>4. Link Building</h2>
<p>This factor also plays a key role in overall performance in search results. Therefore, you need to build quality and <a href="https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/backlinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantity backlinks</a> directing back to your website/web pages. You could gain backlinks by offering guest posts to other websites, which include a backlink to your web pages, press releases through major news resources, and spreading content on social media networks with an intention to get shared by your followers.</p>
<p>The above discussed are just basic SEO techniques but are still helpful if you are new to this industry. However, ensure to learn further techniques and apply them on your website to skyrocket the performance of your startup business or company.</p>
