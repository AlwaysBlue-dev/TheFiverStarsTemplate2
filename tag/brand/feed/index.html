										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The company profile is a short description of your business. It&#8217;s a way to introduce your company and its products or services to the world, helping people understand what you do and how they can get in touch with you. You can use it as an opportunity to build trust with clients who don&#8217;t know much about you yet, or even as an opportunity for them to learn more about who they&#8217;re buying from.</p>
<p>Company profiles are also good for marketing purposes: by showing off what makes your enterprise unique (or similar), potential clients will be more likely to open up about their needs—and that&#8217;s when sales come in!</p>
<p>A company profile can be written in a number of different ways. You could write it yourself or hire someone to do it for you. The most important thing is that there must be consistency between all of your company profiles so that people know what they are buying when they look at one website or another.</p>
<h2>Benefits of a Company Profile </h2>
<p>Company profile is important for large as well as for small businesses that want to grow fast. It helps you stand out from the competition, attract new customers and build trust with your existing ones. The pursuing are some of the advantages;</p>
<ul>
<li>It serves as a great marketing tool</li>
<li>Helps your company stand out</li>
<li>Builds brand awareness &#038; credibility</li>
<li>Gives a sentiment about your products and services</li>
<li>Helps in the recruitment process</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use a company profile to increase sales by <a href="https://www.digitaltrails.co.uk/10-steps-to-create-and-maintain-a-positive-brand-image/" target="_blank" title="company profile design service" rel="noopener">creating a positive brand image</a> for your business. This will help customers choose products or services from you over competitors because they know that what you sell is good quality or genuine in nature.</p>
<p>You can use the company profile as a marketing tool to attract more customers by displaying information about how much money was spent on advertising campaigns, how many people attended events etc., which shows them how committed these companies are toward their customers’ satisfaction levels (and thus increases chances of making repeat purchases).</p>
<h2>How to Create a Company Profile</h2>
<p>A company profile is a summary of your business. It should be short and concise, clear and easy to understand, and have a good visual design. The information you provide should be up-to-date at all times so that potential customers can see what you are offering right now in the marketplace as well as look forward to future plans.</p>
<p>A company profile should be written in simple English text with no technical terms or jargon. The graphics and images used in the company profile must be top-notch with attention to detail. It should not be overly long as it will not be read by many people including potential customers or clients who might contact you for services or products. </p>
<p>If possible, try to use an even amount of slides, images, and text so that there is sufficient room for other important information such as contact details and website URL address, etc.</p>

<h2>Pros and Cons of a Company Profile </h2>
<p>A company profile is a document that outlines the history of a company and its mission. It&#8217;s often used by potential investors or business partners to get an idea of what a company does and how it works. A company profile can also be used as an example for writing other kinds of documentation, like blog posts, press releases, or marketing collateral.</p>
<h3>Pros </h3>
<p>A company profile is a summary of your company&#8217;s values and goals, as well as its mission. It should be easy to read, but also provide details about what you&#8217;re passionate about as an organization and what makes you special. A good company profile will show that you understand your target audience—which is why it&#8217;s so important for businesses that want to stand out in their field!</p>
<h3>Pros </h3>
<p>Some people may not like the idea of a company profile. It can be hard to keep up with the latest news and developments, especially if you&#8217;re not involved in the industry. The process of creating a company profile can be time-consuming, so if you&#8217;re looking for something quick and easy, this might not be for you. Creating a company profile is expensive—you&#8217;ll need someone who has expertise in writing about businesses or startups (or both) who will charge per hour based on their estimate of how long it takes them to complete each task they are asked to do by your organization(s).</p>
<h2>Is a Company Profile Really Important for a Business? </h2>
<p><strong>The answer is yes</strong>, a company profile is really important for a business.</p>
<p>A company profile can be a tool to tell people about your business, it helps you to build trust with your customers and it helps you stand out from the competition. This will attract more potential clients who are looking for something different than what they have already seen on other websites or social media platforms.</p>
<p>Company profile is really important for small businesses that want to grow fast. It helps potential customers to understand your company and product better, build trust with them, create brand awareness and grow your business.</p>
<p>When having a company profile on LinkedIn, helps people find out more about you so that they can get in touch with you if they have any questions or need assistance with something corresponding to what you do.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We hope this blog has made you understand the importance of a company profile and how to build one. The next step is to start <a href="https://zeracreative.com/company-profile-writing-designing-company-pakistan/" title="company profile design service">designing your company profile</a>, but it’s a good idea to keep these tips in mind while you do so.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays everybody is hung up on the idea of searching for any query on <strong>Google</strong>.</p>

<p>1. Positioning Through Visibility</h2>
<p>Business is all about <em>positioning</em>.</p>
<p>If you’re one up in a position to your target audience, you can mint far more dollars and authority over them. Whereas, if you reach them out, you hand over that positioning prowess to them.</p>
<p>We know it’s a bit of a “wrapping head around” concept, but hold tight we will walk you through it… Positioning in terms of SEO means is, when we create content based on customers&#8217; problems, we position ourselves as those who will help them out.</p>
<p>Those who’re solving problems while asking nothing for it at first. This gives you a massive positioning edge, and if you continuously produce content that steers them to your solution.</p>
<p>Voila! You have a secret to their heart and their sacred money… But, hey! This isn’t that easier than you might think.</p>
<p>To really get benefit from a position through SEO, you MUST gain top Google places for most keywords that journey your customers to your offer.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.zerolimitweb.com/organic-vs-ppc-2021-ctr-results-best-practices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">71.33% clicks happen</a> on the first page of Google for any search term.</p>
<p>If you don’t know how to secure top places, you can reach us and we’re happy to <a href="/contact">assist</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Web Traffic Without Banking On Ads</h2>
<p>As we all know that paid ads can take a toll on your budget and squeeze it out, if the targeting wasn’t on point, or the message wasn’t as effective.</p>
<p>There are other crucial tricks of the trades that also need to be considered for running paid campaigns. Relying totally on them is a Nah! Nah! strategy.</p>
<p>And as we touched on earlier, reaching them out by targeting them instead of them reaching you out is a low-position, low-status strategy…<br />
Point is, to generate a stable business where customers could come and knock on your door while you sleep day in and day out &#8212; SEO would be your best bet.</p>
<p>No! We aren’t against paid marketing…</p>
<p>In fact, we are huge proponents of that. But what you need to understand is, Paid ads can help you acquire leads in days, though you can’t always bank on Paid ads due to certain complications and always the risk of losing money.</p>
<p>Plus, here you’re reaching them out, &#8212; remember positioning?</p>
<h2>3. Improves Trustworthiness</h2>
<p>Where their money is involved, there is some sure doubt. Doubt could be related to anything…</p>
<p>Optimizing your content is a wonderful way to subdue any doubts. Let’s understand this concept with a scenario, when your customers want to do business with you, especially if big bucks are involved, they would definitely run a Google search.</p>
<p>To see what you’re up to… This is something you might have done as well… Haven’t you?</p>
<p>When you optimize your website or online business for search engines, your customers will deem you worthy as a lot would pop up when they search.</p>
<p>Also, when they go through the content you’ve created, it further plants a seed in their heads of trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Which would give you a massive positioning edge… Not only will your customers shoot to work with you, but also they’d be willing to pay you the premium.</p>
<h2>4. Can Sell To Customers Using Targeted Keywords</h2>
<p>Did you know <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/87-of-shoppers-now-begin-product-searches-online/530139/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">87% of shoppers</a> find products through online search?</p>
<p>Not 10, 20, or 50… It’s 87%! What it illustrates is if businesses don’t optimize their websites for search engines, they leave an enormous sum of money on the table. What about those who optimize? Well, they’re having a ball… Simple as that.</p>
<p>Here’s your opportunity to craft content around keywords that your audience is searching for so you can nudge your target audience towards a solution. (Whisper* your solution). We can’t emphasize enough on this. Again it boils down to <em>positioning</em>. (Ugh, yet again…)</p>
<p>The more you show up for keywords your target audience is searching for, the better positioning you’ll have that you can leverage to sell them. You can search out what keywords your target market is mostly searching for and create content around it. Isn&#8217;t it awesome? BTW, winning top search engine places in the neck-to-neck online competition is a ferocious task that requires a heck load of work and an understanding of certain strategies.</p>
<p>If you stuck to this, who would focus on scaling the business? Amidst of all this, you can reach us out and we’ll help you <a href="https://zeracreative.com/seo-company-pakistan/">rank your website higher in google search</a>.</p>
<h2>5. SEO for Better User Experience UI</h2>
<p>A website that follows good SEO practices always gives off a better user experience. Let us explain this to you, people consider those two aspects separate, however, they are as interlinked as online business and internet connection.</p>
<p>Without an internet connection, online business is nothing but a mere dream and vice versa. Same as, aesthetics and clear navigations are important both for user experience to flip pages and pace around without much problem and for SEO… Without optimizing website aesthetics and ensuring sleek navigations Google will deduct SEO points. Since navigation tells Google what the content is about, and in which category it lies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=477687" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4223" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/58da17cf.jpg" alt="7 Reasons Why SEO is necessary for Your Online Business - 58da17cf - Zera Creative" width="900" height="90" title="7 Reasons Why SEO is necessary for Your Online Business 5"></a></p>
<p>And aesthetics make it easy for users to stay around for long. The point being SEO and UI go hand in hand. Let’s understand this with another example, take page speed and Mobile friendliness for the matter of discussion… <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/mobile-page-speed-google-rankings-user-experience/234739/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Page speed and mobile friendliness</a> are two important aspects of user experience.</p>
<p>Without a responsive and fast site, a website would always repel users. Since it repels users, it’s bad for SEO. And because of these two reasons Google deems content unworthy and relegates it below competitors. The point is for a good website it must have proper integration of SEO and UI.</p>
<h2>6. Market Knowledge</h2>
<p>SEO helps understand what’s working in the industry. The more you bank on SEO, the more you remain on top of the trends. What it means, to stay competitive in your industry on Google SERPs, you must know what are the latest updates in your industry.</p>
<p>Upon knowing, create content around the hot topics. Because if you don’t your competitors will. And that’s not a good place to be in. Right?</p>
<p><strong>Staying up to date with the trends has two benefits:,</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>You can turn a lot of visitors to your website by leveraging the power of currently in-demand or top-of-the-head topics that your target audience is searching for.<br />
<strong>B: </strong>Based on what’s currently working, you can predict the forthcoming trends and make your strategy regarding it beforehand.</p>
<p>This is the easiest way to hack your way to profits.</p>
<h2>7. Long-Term Strategy That Pays Dividends</h2>
<p>We said it before, and we are saying it again. SEO is not flipping your fingers to get clients&#8217; strategy… It’s a long arduous strategy that initially won’t add much to your bottom line, but 6 months later, or a year later you’d witness some changes.</p>
<p>More inbound leads are coming to fill out the form to work with you or buy your product. Provided that your website is properly optimized on the latest Google guidelines. If it’s, congratulations, you’re about to take off and make huge leaps in your business.</p>
<h2>Wrap Up</h2>
<p>This post enlightens you about the effectiveness of SEO for online businesses. For businesses that intend to flourish and generate organic and inbound leads while they sleep, then there’s no better strategy than doing proper SEO of your website.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that it takes time to pick up the momentum and win Google&#8217;s trust. Are you ready to run a marathon?</p>
<p>Anyway, if you are unsure of the process, &#8212; don’t &#8212; just don’t, we’ll take care of it. If you <a href="/contact">head to us</a>, we ensure we do proper <a href="https://zeracreative.com/best-seo-company-in-karachi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO of your website</a> that beats competitors over time and win you organic leads.</p>

<p>Here are 5 steps to follow in order to find your dream design studio:</p>
<h2>1. Keep The End Goal in Mind</h2>
<p>When looking for a design studio, keep in mind the requirements of your business needs. What is your aim after hiring them? How will this studio propel your business’s success? Remember the end goal of hiring a design studio for your business; this could be something along the lines of</p>
<ul>
<li>Initiate a new type of brand advertising which will create greater recognition for the business as well as generate monthly revenue and profits</li>
<li>Using the help of rebranding to increase sales by 10-20%</li>
<li>Developing a customer-centric mobile app that works to build customer engagement</li>
<li>Enhance <a href="https://zeracreative.com/best-seo-company-in-karachi/">SEO</a> of your blog to increase the visibility of your website to the world</li>
</ul>
<p>When you have set these goals, it is important that you note the areas of expertise your shortlisted design studios offer. Do they offer the services that will help you to meet these goals? Do they have the right portfolio to support these services? How popular is its social media presence? Are their testimonials supporting their services as well?</p>
<p>Make sure while hiring the design studio, that it not only “looks good,” but it has to be more specific, detailed, and much more meaningful. Write down a few goals and check which agency provides the greatest potential and ability to help the business out.</p>
<h2>2. Get Inspired</h2>
<p>Find popular, well-known agencies and <a href="https://zeracreative.com/branding-logo-design-company-pakistan/">design studios</a> and sift through their work. Does it serve as an inspiration? Is it in line with what you want your business to look like, or is your <a href="https://zeracreative.com/wordpress-development-company/">website</a> or mobile app, branding, exactly in line with what you have in mind? Find a particular design, font, layout, logo, colors, and inspirational images that catch your eye and which depict the feel of what you want from your brand, etc.</p>
<p>The more specific you are with your choices and inspirational feel, the greater the possibility of finding the best-suited studio. You can always go to Pinterest to decide on your inspiration.</p>
<h2>3. Start Searching</h2>
<p>Once proper outlines have been made regarding finding the best studio, it’s time to start searching. Now, this may take some work. First, start with one’s inner circle and business colleagues. Ask around about who knows of a few design studios and whether they can help out with getting in touch with them. Next, try searching online. Although Google may have innumerable results for the words “design studio,” try putting in one’s location to narrow down and find specific, helpful results.</p>
<p>Check out their <a href="https://zeracreative.com/work/">portfolios</a> and websites, see what one likes and delve further into the details. Do they update their website frequently? Do they have good reviews from their clients?  Look at which businesses they’ve worked for in the past and how successful have they been in giving their clients what they want.</p>
<p>By going through all this effort, finding a design studio that identifies with the business’ beliefs, ideologies, and guarantees to deliver become much easier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=477687" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4223" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/58da17cf.jpg" alt="5 Steps to Follow to Hire a Great Design Studio for your Business - 58da17cf - Zera Creative" width="900" height="90" title="5 Steps to Follow to Hire a Great Design Studio for your Business 11"></a></p>
<h2>4. Make The First Move</h2>
<p>Once you’ve narrowed down which design studios suit the business the best, start contacting them. The most common and efficient method is by picking up the phone or e-mailing the agencies. If composing an e-mail, make it formal as well as precise and make sure to leave all of your contact details so they can reach back easily.</p>
<p>Try and contact as many studios as possible, so that if one doesn’t respond, another surely will. Give every agency a full week to reply back, just in case they are busy with other clients. Once the replies come in, pay close attention to which agency responds best and which one makes the best connection with you. Comparing responses helps to decide which studio is more invested in working with you.</p>
<h2>5. Cost Effective</h2>
<p>One very important factor involved in finding the best designer studio is to consider the costs. Make sure that the preferred studio and your business are on the same page when it comes to the cost of producing and designing through the studio.</p>
<p>If you are a small start-up then the best studio would be the one that works on a small scale in a more affordable manner. It is essential that the budget is discussed before finalizing which designer studio to choose from. This way, finding the best designer studio becomes a whole lot easier and more effective!</p>
<p>Overall, it can be said that finding the best design studio that suits one’s needs will take time and research. But once the dream studio is found, a lovely partnership blossoms, guaranteeing success and growth for both, the studio and the business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As people of the twenty-first century, whenever we require more information on something, our first instinct is to look it up on the internet with the help of a search engine. Chances are that almost always 4 out of 5 people will click on the website that shows up first. If one is keen on taking their website to the next level, SEO may be just the genie-in-lamp you are looking for!</p>
<p>In order to increase your website’s chances of being frequently clicked on and visited, knowing and applying the concepts of SEO or search engine optimization, is essential.</p>
<h2>So, what is SEO?</h2>
<p>It stands for Search Engine Optimization, a metaphoric rulebook for companies/website owners to follow in order to help increase their website’s ranking on any search engine.</p>
<h2>Why is it so important?</h2>
<p>In very basic terms, SEO will only benefit the website itself, making it more accessible, available, user-friendly and trustworthy.</p>
<p>Nowadays, using search engines has become second nature to us. Millions of users take the help of results offered by these engines such as Google and Bing in order to find information. School work, news reports and almost everything that is available online are found through search engines.</p>
<p>So, let us see how you can improve your website’s SEO:</p>
<h2>1. Not Another Trust-Building Exercise!</h2>
<p>SEO is significant because it helps internet users become familiar with one’s website and eventually learn to trust the results it produces. If one’s website shows up more often on the first page of results, chances are more people get to see the website, click on it and if satisfied, build a reliance on the website regarding their experience. This way the website helps gather visitors, customers, and clients with the help of SEO by building trust.</p>
<h2>2. First Search, Then Share!</h2>
<p>Build and perfect your own personal profile first. Share your business profile URLs within your own profile, populate your about section with key details of your business, and mention the kind of products and services you offer. Your personal profile should be a visual landscape of your business so that people can relate to your business easily.</p>
<p>Even if you do not portray yourself as a brand or a person behind your brand, you can still mark the products and services on your personal profile, to denote your support for them. Promote key elements of your business and your blog on your personal profile to indicate your support as well.</p>
<h2>3. First Place</h2>
<p>If more than one website is selling or promoting the same thing, websites with search engine optimization are more likely to grab the attention of customers and viewers who will see the website show up in the first few results. This way cut-throat competition between websites can be won with the help of SEO.</p>
<h2>4. Cost-Effective</h2>
<p>SEO is especially important for small-sized businesses that are looking to advertise themselves without going way over their allocated budget. It allows one to do cost-effective marketing through search engines. If you have a budget, you can always use keywords to promote your website through advertisements thus increasing your chances of visibility in the search results. This way, the SEO helps to create an online presence through the website’s frequent appearance on search engine results.</p>
<p>Just realize that a <a href="https://www.webfx.com/seo/learn/seo-friendly-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search engine optimized website</a> has twice the advantage compared to a website that is not. Therefore, choosing to apply SEO principles to one’s websites may just be the fuel required to help the company’s spaceship to skyrocket!</p>
<p><strong>Here are a few key steps in order to build a great SEO for one’s website:</strong></p>
<h3>SEO Tip #1:</h3>
<p>It’s all about the title! Make sure that every blog post/article posted on the website contains an eye-catching title that includes certain specific keywords that when searched for, show up in the first few results because they are included in the article. For SEO that is specific to a country, refer to cities and use indigenous terms that make the title of the article more relevant in order to show up first.</p>
<h3>SEO Tip #2:</h3>
<p>Along with that, use keywords frequently within the post as well, preferably in the first paragraph to build good SEO for the website. The more common terms, phrases, and keywords used that people tend to search for, the greater the foundation for fantastic search engine optimization! To do that, use keyword research tools that can help you find good keywords to use. Also, try using long-tail keywords that are longer phrases that people use to search on search engines.</p>
<h3>SEO Tip #3:</h3>
<p>Link it up! Make sure to provide users on the website, with suggestions for other articles and blog posts related to the searched article. This way it allows users to keep up to date with new and old posts that they might be interested in checking out. With interconnected links or internal link building, you have better chances of improving your website’s SEO over time. Same goes for external link building through social media submissions, publishing articles and news items that have your <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/url" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website’s URLs</a>, and directory submissions.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Overall, it can be said that building good SEO takes time but it pays off in the end. For beginners, it is a new venture into the big sea of business advances. However, good SEO may just be the best way to garner attention from internet users and eventually build clients!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If your business has finally been able to muster the courage and venture into the ever-growing world of technology and mobile apps, today’s your lucky day! Before being able to hire the best studio to develop one’s dearly beloved app, it’s important to answer these 5 key questions to help one make the best of decisions.</p>
<p>The chance of one’s business skyrocketing to success is can only an app away! But first, here are some key questions to ask yourself before hiring an App Development Studio:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4737 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-scaled.jpg" alt="5 Questions You Need To Evaluate the Right App Development Studio - infographic 10 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1920" height="936" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-scaled.jpg 1920w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-300x146.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-1024x499.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-768x374.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-1536x748.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-2048x998.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-960x468.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-600x292.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-1313x640.jpg 1313w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-800x390.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" title="5 Questions You Need To Evaluate the Right App Development Studio 14"></p>
<h2>1. Are Their Portfolios of My Liking?</h2>
<p>Finding an App Development Studio that suits one’s requirements the best can be a lot of work as it involves skimming through various app development portfolios and searching for the most successful app developers.</p>
<p>However, if one sees something they like, it’s probably the first sign that this could be the potential “right” App Studio. Look through their portfolios, many of which can be found on their websites, and see whether their work fits with what one has in mind for their own future business’ app. Be observant of how much progress they have made in the past year and whether they specialize in the industry that one requires (e.g. Fitness, Social Media or Games).</p>
<p>Not only that, but check the reviews for their apps online at the <a href="https://www.google.com.pk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV24TCuazXAhUGqo8KHSGeDwQQFggjMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%3Fhl%3Den&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Yjl1oQSF0yePbWWRpp2jt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Store</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com.pk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV4cjMuazXAhUJpI8KHfppDPQQFggjMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fgenre%2Fios%2Fid36%3Fmt%3D8&amp;usg=AOvVaw34cC7wO8XCwshkhf59tXG3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AppStore</a>. Do their customers complain of bugs and lagging of the app? Have they made improvements to their app after all the complaints? How many stars have people given their apps? Do extensive research regarding what various studios have put out into the world of apps and how successful have they been?</p>
<p>If one likes what they see, this is an indication of having answered the first essential question before hiring an App Development studio.</p>
<h2>2. Who Are Their Past and Present Clients? Are They Satisfied?</h2>
<p>Take a look at who their clients were and currently are. Get in touch with them, contact this studio’s clients and don’t be afraid to ask. Get to know how their experience was. Was it amazing? Was it satisfactory or was it horrid? Ask them about the challenges they faced, how the studio dealt with them as a client and would they be open to working with this studio again?</p>
<p>By digging deep and finding out others’ hands-on experience, one will be able to get an idea of what it would be like to work with this particular studio. This is how the second question regarding hiring the dream app development studio is answered.</p>
<p>Not only will this help in narrowing one’s decision as to which studios to worth spending time on, but it will help give one a clear idea of what kind of experience as well as a response they require by hiring a particular studio.</p>
<h2>3. What Platform Are They Capable of Developing For?</h2>
<p>If one aims to make an app accessible to all customers and users, what is the best platform to make it available on? If one already has a platform in mind, does this particular App Development Studio allow the business to release an app on it? Getting to know if the studio has the ability to develop an app that is more suited for iOS or Android users? Will the app be available to users of all devices or just some? Will the app be available worldwide or only in the Pakistan?</p>
<p>These questions are important to ask as well as answer in order to hire a studio that is able to fulfill the technical requirements.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=477687" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4223" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/58da17cf.jpg" alt="5 Questions You Need To Evaluate the Right App Development Studio - 58da17cf - Zera Creative" width="900" height="90" title="5 Questions You Need To Evaluate the Right App Development Studio 15"></a></p>
<h2>4. How Much Time Will It Take?</h2>
<p>How long will one be willing to wait for their dream app to be made? And how long will the App Development Studio take? If there’s a deadline that needs to be met, will this trusted studio be able to make it in time? Be sure to ask how practical it is for this studio to be able to produce what you want in the amount of time specified by them. If this particular studio is not too sure about delivering what one requires, look to hire another studio that can promise an efficient, quick, and responsible service.</p>
<p>Also, evaluate if support is provided after the development work is completed. If the warranty period is missing, or if support and maintenance are not provided, then it is time to look for a studio that does.</p>
<p>Maintenance and support can help with changes, new feature addition, and any updates that may be required due to OS updates. Zera Creative provides up to <a href="https://zeracreative.com/monthly-website-maintenance-service-pakistan/">3 months of free maintenance support</a> post-delivery, after which it provides support and maintenance at reasonable rates.</p>
<h2>5. How Much Will It Cost? Is This Studio Budget-Friendly?</h2>
<p>Now, this is an important question to ask. A lot of the time, companies and studios can be very promising and successful; however, they can be way out of the business’ budget. It’s better to choose a small, affordable studio rather than hiring an over-the-top, expensive, popular studio that leaves one in debt.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is essential to ask oneself whether hiring this studio will allow one to still remain within their financial boundaries.</p>
<h2>6. Will The App Make Money? How Will The Profit Be Split?</h2>
<p>Another important thing to consider asking is if the mobile app makes revenue, how much will the Studio charge? Will there be a 50-50 split on profit? It is important to decide how much is to be charged for the development of the app so that a studio can be hired that is able to deliver as well as keep their promise of charging fairly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, it can be said that hiring the <a href="https://zeracreative.com">perfect App Development Studio</a> takes time, effort, and in-depth research about what one actually expects from the launch of a mobile application. Nevertheless, if one looks hard and long enough, they’ll find what they’re looking for.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Small businesses and blogs often struggle in building a great blog audience who loves to read their work and avail their products and services. Larger businesses often market through mainstream media like television, print, billboards, and activations. Smaller businesses and blogs struggle in promoting their actionable content and their services or products to their audience. That is when <a href="https://zeracreative.com/">social media</a> steps in. There are some key ways to promote your business and your blog without having to break the bank!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4739 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-scaled.jpg" alt="12 Ways To Leverage Social Media And Build Blog Audience! - infographic 11 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1920" height="1301" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-scaled.jpg 1594w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-300x203.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-1024x694.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-768x520.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-1536x1041.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-2048x1388.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-960x651.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-600x407.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-944x640.jpg 944w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-800x542.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" title="12 Ways To Leverage Social Media And Build Blog Audience! 17"></p>
<h2>Start Your Promotion From Home</h2>
<p>More often than not, blogs and businesses come up with great services, solutions, products, and content. But it keeps sitting on the shelves or websites waiting for someone to show up. Promotion of the brand, however, starts from home. Bring out your social media profiles, and actively promote your services and posts with your friends and family. If they are part of the audience profile you came up with, then these are the first step towards building a blog audience. Even though sometimes, they may not share the same view of how great your brand is, or could be, building numbers on your blog, product or service, can help build a better word of mouth.</p>
<h2>Work On Your Personal Profile</h2>
<p>Build and perfect your own personal profile first. Share your business profile URLs within your own profile, populate your about us section with key details of your business, and mention the kind of products and services you offer. Your personal profile should be a visual landscape of your business so that people can relate you to your business easily. Even if you do not portray yourself as a brand or a person behind your brand, you can still mark the products and services on your personal profile, to denote your support for them. Promote key elements of your business and your blog on your personal profile to indicate your support as well.</p>
<h2>Start Building A Network</h2>
<p>Building a network online and offline can be key in generating leads, building a blog audience, and promoting your brand to your target audiences. Networking can help with recall as people start recognizing the brand. This brand recall can become stronger the more you participate online as well as offline in the communities where your target audiences are found. For example, there are several groups on LinkedIn, Facebook and communities across different forums where your target audiences may hang out. Work to build a strong network in these communities, by helping answer queries, talking to people in general, and communicating with the audiences.</p>
<h2>Participate In All The Right Places</h2>
<p>While networking would indicate hanging out where your audiences are, and getting to know them. Participation would often involve you to be in places that your audiences would be. For example, if your audience profile is such that they would be found amongst social media channels such as LinkedIn and Snapchat that most businesses never think about, then, by all means, participate and use these channels.  If you are actively participating in channels that are the right fit with your blog audience, then you can continue to reap benefits as more visitors come on to your website.</p>
<h2>Engage With Your Target Audience</h2>
<p>While engagement and networking on social media platforms will bring you most of your audience, you should also consider engaging with your target blog audience on other platforms and forums. Social Media is one key to the larger scheme of finding and collecting audience. Another key is finding the audience on forums and communities where engagement can be done through answering questions, posting questions, and sharing anecdotes and stories. With this engagement, your net worth is built and your expertise is highlighted. Quora is a general forum where all sort of audience is found. You can conduct a basic Google Search to find communities that resonate with your brand, to find more audiences there.</p>
<h2>Claim Your Name</h2>
<p>While social media can be a great audience builder, a key tip that most entrepreneurs fail to realize is that your name should be standard across all platforms. This includes your domain name, your social media channel names across different mediums, and your profiles. A singular name can help in finding your social media pages/profiles quickly rather than having to hunt through them. This can build familiarity amongst your audience for an easier transition from your social media page or profile to your website.</p>
<h2>Get Yourself Published</h2>
<p>Most small businesses have found their audiences and claim to fame, through getting published in larger publications. If you prefer to have your name out there amongst your key visitors, then aim to get published. Some key publications that take in articles from various bloggers and businesses include Huffington Post, Forbes, Inc.com, BuzzFeed, and more. You should also use mediums such as LinkedIn and Medium to build your and your brand&#8217;s online presence. It helps when a person searches out on the search engine and comes across details that build your online presence and display you as an expert or a knowledge leader in your field.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Forget Local Networking</h2>
<p>While most businesses work on building a seamless <a href="https://zeracreative.com/">social media</a> presence, local networking is often forgotten. A lot of your audience can come directly from word of mouth. Find out local networking groups, volunteering options, churches, and meetups that you can go to. These have people who are generally going to be like-minded. They will be more in tune based on the kind of audience profile you have created. These audiences can be a great boost in terms of word of mouth for your business as well as your blog.</p>
<h2>Get Your Business Cards Out</h2>
<p>Business cards are often the least used item in a small business or blog. But they can bring about a great boost to your blog if used in the right manner. A business card generally should contain social media channel IDs as well for the receiver to relate to your social media presence. Business cards can help you connect with your audience. They are a great help in brand recall when the receiver views the card again. Both physical and digital business cards can help in this case.</p>
<h2>Get Your Audience To Share</h2>
<p>Once your audience is visiting your blog or your website, the next step is to add options that allow your audience to share your goodness with the world. If you use a WordPress website, there are some key plugins that allow you to create toolbars for social media sharing. Similarly, for other websites built on other platforms, you can build social media sharing toolbars that allow your audience to share your posts, products or services on their profiles.</p>
<h2>Add Click to Tweet Options</h2>
<p>A key trick that quite a few blogs have used recently for good measure is the <a href="https://clicktotweet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click to Tweet</a> Option. You can also build this feature in your blog through plugins and codes. A specific phrase or sentence can be converted into a tweet and embedded into your content. The audience can readily share that piece on their Twitter profile by clicking on the Click To Tweet button. This way, your content is shared with the world, without significant effort from the audience itself. You can leverage social media profiles of your readers to get more audience onto your website this way.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Forget Lesser Used Channels</h2>
<p>More often than not, you can find your blog audience on social media channels that you may personally not be using. For example, some audience may be available on Pinterest, Instagram, Snapchat and LinkedIn. Usually, we may use these channels as a user but not as a small business owner or a blogger. However, these are great hubs to find great audience profiles and build your <a href="https://zeracreative.com/">social media</a> presence. For example, Pinterest is a key tool that a lot of people use to search for relevant content. You can leverage this idea by promoting your products, services and blog posts directly to your blog audience, on Pinterest boards for people to find, share and redirect to your <a href="https://zeracreative.com/">website</a>!</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1475" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/voorp-media-is-now-zera-creative-agency.jpg" alt="Voorp Media is now Zera Creaive - voorp media is now zera creative agency - Zera Creative" width="1200" height="801" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/voorp-media-is-now-zera-creative-agency.jpg 1200w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/voorp-media-is-now-zera-creative-agency-300x200.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/voorp-media-is-now-zera-creative-agency-768x513.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/voorp-media-is-now-zera-creative-agency-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/voorp-media-is-now-zera-creative-agency-960x641.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/voorp-media-is-now-zera-creative-agency-600x401.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/voorp-media-is-now-zera-creative-agency-959x640.jpg 959w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/voorp-media-is-now-zera-creative-agency-800x534.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" title="Voorp Media is now Zera Creaive 27"></p>
<p>Voorp Media was started on June 3rd, 2016 as a website development agency by <em>Noushad Ranani</em> and has grown into a multiple-service marketing agency for local Pakistani businesses. The case study includes why we wanted to re-brand and everything that we needed to consider before making the big decision.</p>
<p>It highlights our biggest tasks such as designing a new website that would communicate to the world who the new brand was as well as the most challenging hurdles we needed to overcome a successful execution. Now the new <a href="/"><em>Zera Creative</em></a> brand has launched, here is our case study on how we planned and delivered it.</p>
<h2>The Reasons behind the rebrand</h2>
<ol>
<li>The big decision for us to rebrand and change from a website agency to fully integrated 360-degrees Creative &amp; Digital Agency.</li>
<li>Voorp Media name wasn&#8217;t easy to pronounce for our clients.</li>
<li>Voorp Media did not have any clear brand direction or niche.</li>
<li>We wanted to be new and fresh again.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What did our rebrand mean for our clients?</h2>
<p>Before such rebranding ideas occur, queries of how this would affect our current position had to be thought out and most importantly communicated. As a website agency that has enjoyed great success in the website development sector, it was important to communicate to the public and existing clients that having a company website is very much still a strong skill of ours as well as still being an important focus for the company. It was not about the totally disregarding Website, but rather about Website Development becoming a result of great integrated marketing which is now the future. Our concentration to still carry out great Brand Websites with our current and prospective clients will still be one of the main focuses, but will also be complemented by the new digital marketing techniques.</p>
<h2>What are our new niche and industries?</h2>
<p>The following are a select set of industries in which Ironpaper possesses extra specialization. With the following industries, we have demonstrated an ability to make a clear and measurable impact on clients due to our deep industry expertise.</p>
<blockquote><p>Fashion, Lifestyle, E-commerce, Fitness, Creative Startups, Restaurants, Hospitality, and Tourism.</p></blockquote>
<h2>New Brand &#8211; Zera Creative</h2>
<p>Firstly the re-brand had to encompass one thing to make Zera Creative’s mark; namely consistency.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1483 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/zera-logo-dark.png" alt="Voorp Media is now Zera Creaive - zera logo dark - Zera Creative" width="200" height="84" title="Voorp Media is now Zera Creaive 28"></p>
<p>From the new website showing off the agency’s new identity right down to our email footer, everything about Zera Creative as a digital marketing and creative agency had to be consistent to one another.</p>
