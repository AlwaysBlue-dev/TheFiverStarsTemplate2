										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last few years, marketing trends for small as well as large businesses have observed a major shift. Almost every business has put major efforts into establishing a strong online presence to accomplish the desired goals. Formerly, local businesses gained popularity by advertising through local papers or by distributing pamphlets among local people.</p>
<p>Although the competition was not as fierce as today, it took plenty of time for business owners to establish their solid presence in the competitive market. Now, if you are looking to start your new business and having an official website is not a part of your immediate plan, you may need to rethink your strategy. A search-engine-optimized website is not less than a prerequisite for businesses nowadays. All your <a href="https://zeracreative.com/social-media-management-services-in-karachi-pakistan/">marketing </a>efforts begin as soon as you accomplish this first and most vital step.</p>
<p>So, how exactly can a website take your business to a next level? Here are some of the highlighted factors that can help your business grow with much less effort applied.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=477687" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4223" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/58da17cf.jpg" alt="How a Website can Take Your Business to a Next Level - 58da17cf - Zera Creative" width="900" height="90" title="How a Website can Take Your Business to a Next Level 3"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><img class="alignnone wp-image-4754 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/infographic-17-scaled.jpg" alt="How a Website can Take Your Business to a Next Level - infographic 17 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1920" height="1032" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/infographic-17-scaled.jpg 1920w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/infographic-17-300x161.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/infographic-17-1024x550.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/infographic-17-768x413.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/infographic-17-1536x825.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/infographic-17-2048x1100.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/infographic-17-960x516.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/infographic-17-600x322.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/infographic-17-1191x640.jpg 1191w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/infographic-17-800x430.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" title="How a Website can Take Your Business to a Next Level 4"></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enhanced Online Presence</p>
<p>Having a website for your business minimizes the gap between your prospects and your services. Think of your website as the front desk of your office. Any customer that comes in will most likely arrive at the front desk and ask for what he/she is looking for. If the front desk fails to create a humble impression, your customer may not spend a lot of time and leave. Just the same way, a website makes or breaks your brand image to all your web visitors. A simple yet easy-to-navigate website can engage more users as compared to a fancy yet complicated one.</p>
<p>For example, if you are selling a product and your website displays plenty of information about your business instead of what you are selling, then your website visitors may not spend much time on your website. It is vital to display relevant information at your homepage for improved customer engagement.</p>
<h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
<p>Once you have a website, your doors to internet marketing are wide open. You can create your business profiles on <a href="https://zeracreative.com/social-media-management-services-in-karachi-pakistan/">social media</a> and integrate them with your website. Professional social sites such as LinkedIn can help you expand your network by connecting with relevant business communities (Both B2B and B2C). Facebook and Instagram are highly effective in increasing brand outreach.</p>
<p>You can use Facebook to create specialized marketing campaigns with complete control of your desired audience, demographics, and campaign objectives. You can start with a minimum budget and monitor your campaigns thoroughly. Targeting a specific audience helps to filter irrelevant web traffic and maximizes the chances of conversions.</p>
<h2>Reputation &amp; Reviews</h2>
<p>Having an online presence means that you can appear on any digital device at any time when searched by your business name or by the offered services. Business profiles on social media as well as the search engine’s local 3-pack (local business profile on Google) showcase customer reviews. These reviews help to make or break a brand’s reputation in the competitive circle.</p>
<p>Most internet users tend to choose or reject a business based on positive or negative reviews respectively. You can retain a positive reputation by asking your happy customers to write positive reviews. This way, half of your marketing efforts will eventually reduce.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While a <a href="https://zeracreative.com/website-development-company-in-karachi-pakistan/">business website</a> can help you minimize the distance between you and your clients, it also acts as a gateway to millions of internet marketing possibilities. All you need to do is take the first step by getting a market-oriented web design for your business and then you can accomplish your desired marketing goals with a minimum cost to spend.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today’s digital world, the consumer has become savvy as well as busy. They spend less and less time going through detailed websites. They are using their cell phones to access the content. The world is coming up with more and more brands, and more and more content. We all reach for our cell phones, waiting for the bus to arrive, or for food to finish warming up in the microwave. Mobile-friendly, responsive websites are key to building a brand and giving relevant content to the audience.</p>
<p>People don&#8217;t like to wait for information. Easier domain names, quicker content blocks that are easy to read, and fast-loading websites on cell phones, all help. Studies indicate that <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/metrics/2010/03/31/firefox-page-load-speed-part-i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">32% consumers would abandon a website if it is slow</a>. Studies also indicate that bounce rate can be improved by 30% if the page size is reduced, and site speed is improved.</p>
<h2>Case for Building a Responsive Website</h2>
<p>A mobile-friendly, responsive website helps your audience to check your website on various platforms and screens, from laptops and phones to tablets. The delivery of content changes but the purpose of the content does not. Do you know that there are more than <a href="https://gsmaintelligence.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four billion people</a> on this planet with cell phones? This means that a lot of your target audience lies in the realm of accessing your website through a cell phone.</p>
<p>Responsive websites mean that the structure of the website can change and adapt to the size of the screen. The user can have a better user experience in accessing your website than if it did not adapt to the type and size of the screen. The website can look good on different screens like cell phones, a tablet, or a laptop as well. Some key elements to take care of include avoiding Flash, and your text to resize instantly based on the type of screen accessing the website. To improve this user experience and to make the website responsive, all your content should be easily accessible on any device.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s search algorithms target websites that are mobile-friendly and responsive. The algorithms that came into place in 2015, give a higher ranking to websites that are responsive and mobile-friendly. For good SEO, mobile-friendly websites are preferable.</p>
<p>As a brand, having a mobile-friendly, responsive website means that you capture more users in your target niche. Any user who is not accessing your website on their computer or laptop can easily access your website on their cell phone. This means that the net of your user base can be broadened. Cutting-edge design based on modern design principles make the website appealing to the users. With strong mobile-friendliness, your website has a better brand image as well.</p>
<h2>How to Get Your Website To Be Mobile Friendly</h2>
<p>The easiest and quickest way to get a website that is mobile-friendly would be to pick up a predesigned theme from a developer or a theme foundry. You should always double-check the different versions on screens to ensure that the website shows perfectly well. If you or your developer decide on modifying the CSS, then you should ensure that responsiveness is not impacted.</p>
<p>Responsive websites need to have a few key elements that you should take care of. Responsive websites usually have a singular column, with the menu becoming more condensed for easier navigation. Colors remain the same but images are reduced to improve the speed and navigation of the website. Websites generally also have links and URLs displayed in a manner that is easy to navigate.</p>
<p>If you are not interested in a predesigned theme, you could also work on the CSS yourself, or hire a developer who has expertise in building mobile-friendly websites. Always check samples to see if the developer has experience in building websites that display well on mobile as well.</p>
<h2>Mobile Optimization Best Practices</h2>
<p>Page speed is key to mobile usage of your website. The brand-building includes several things in today&#8217;s world, and one key is having a high-speed website that is quick to load on a mobile device. Some key areas to take care of include cache, image sizes, and redirects. The cache can help load the website faster, while smaller, more optimized images and lower redirects can also boost page speed.</p>
<p>Avoid elements on your website that can impact user experience. These include Flash, pop-ups, and intricate design. If you need to show special effects, try HTML5 instead. Popups do not display well on mobile sites and are difficult to close. Complicated designs can be difficult to navigate for people with smaller screen-sized phones or fat fingers. Use CSS to develop site display options and themes so that the website can adapt itself to different screens.</p>

<h2>1. Are Their Portfolios of My Liking?</h2>
<p>Finding an App Development Studio that suits one’s requirements the best can be a lot of work as it involves skimming through various app development portfolios and searching for the most successful app developers.</p>
<p>However, if one sees something they like, it’s probably the first sign that this could be the potential “right” App Studio. Look through their portfolios, many of which can be found on their websites, and see whether their work fits with what one has in mind for their own future business’ app. Be observant of how much progress they have made in the past year and whether they specialize in the industry that one requires (e.g. Fitness, Social Media or Games).</p>
<p>Not only that, but check the reviews for their apps online at the <a href="https://www.google.com.pk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV24TCuazXAhUGqo8KHSGeDwQQFggjMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%3Fhl%3Den&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Yjl1oQSF0yePbWWRpp2jt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Store</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com.pk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV4cjMuazXAhUJpI8KHfppDPQQFggjMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fgenre%2Fios%2Fid36%3Fmt%3D8&amp;usg=AOvVaw34cC7wO8XCwshkhf59tXG3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AppStore</a>. Do their customers complain of bugs and lagging of the app? Have they made improvements to their app after all the complaints? How many stars have people given their apps? Do extensive research regarding what various studios have put out into the world of apps and how successful have they been?</p>
<p>If one likes what they see, this is an indication of having answered the first essential question before hiring an App Development studio.</p>
<h2>2. Who Are Their Past and Present Clients? Are They Satisfied?</h2>
<p>Take a look at who their clients were and currently are. Get in touch with them, contact this studio’s clients and don’t be afraid to ask. Get to know how their experience was. Was it amazing? Was it satisfactory or was it horrid? Ask them about the challenges they faced, how the studio dealt with them as a client and would they be open to working with this studio again?</p>
<p>By digging deep and finding out others’ hands-on experience, one will be able to get an idea of what it would be like to work with this particular studio. This is how the second question regarding hiring the dream app development studio is answered.</p>
<p>Not only will this help in narrowing one’s decision as to which studios to worth spending time on, but it will help give one a clear idea of what kind of experience as well as a response they require by hiring a particular studio.</p>
<h2>3. What Platform Are They Capable of Developing For?</h2>
<p>If one aims to make an app accessible to all customers and users, what is the best platform to make it available on? If one already has a platform in mind, does this particular App Development Studio allow the business to release an app on it? Getting to know if the studio has the ability to develop an app that is more suited for iOS or Android users? Will the app be available to users of all devices or just some? Will the app be available worldwide or only in the Pakistan?</p>
<p>These questions are important to ask as well as answer in order to hire a studio that is able to fulfill the technical requirements.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=477687" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4223" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/58da17cf.jpg" alt="5 Questions You Need To Evaluate the Right App Development Studio - 58da17cf - Zera Creative" width="900" height="90" title="5 Questions You Need To Evaluate the Right App Development Studio 10"></a></p>
<h2>4. How Much Time Will It Take?</h2>
<p>How long will one be willing to wait for their dream app to be made? And how long will the App Development Studio take? If there’s a deadline that needs to be met, will this trusted studio be able to make it in time? Be sure to ask how practical it is for this studio to be able to produce what you want in the amount of time specified by them. If this particular studio is not too sure about delivering what one requires, look to hire another studio that can promise an efficient, quick, and responsible service.</p>
<p>Also, evaluate if support is provided after the development work is completed. If the warranty period is missing, or if support and maintenance are not provided, then it is time to look for a studio that does.</p>
<p>Maintenance and support can help with changes, new feature addition, and any updates that may be required due to OS updates. Zera Creative provides up to <a href="https://zeracreative.com/monthly-website-maintenance-service-pakistan/">3 months of free maintenance support</a> post-delivery, after which it provides support and maintenance at reasonable rates.</p>
<h2>5. How Much Will It Cost? Is This Studio Budget-Friendly?</h2>
<p>Now, this is an important question to ask. A lot of the time, companies and studios can be very promising and successful; however, they can be way out of the business’ budget. It’s better to choose a small, affordable studio rather than hiring an over-the-top, expensive, popular studio that leaves one in debt.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is essential to ask oneself whether hiring this studio will allow one to still remain within their financial boundaries.</p>
<h2>6. Will The App Make Money? How Will The Profit Be Split?</h2>
<p>Another important thing to consider asking is if the mobile app makes revenue, how much will the Studio charge? Will there be a 50-50 split on profit? It is important to decide how much is to be charged for the development of the app so that a studio can be hired that is able to deliver as well as keep their promise of charging fairly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, it can be said that hiring the <a href="https://zeracreative.com">perfect App Development Studio</a> takes time, effort, and in-depth research about what one actually expects from the launch of a mobile application. Nevertheless, if one looks hard and long enough, they’ll find what they’re looking for.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brands today popup and they go. This is because the attention span of the average consumer is far less than it has ever been. It is also because there is so much clutter in the media and digital space, that it is difficult to stand out easily. Big, traditional brands, that we have encountered and used for decades have closed down for various reasons. We are all familiar with Pan Am, Nokia, Enron, all of which have closed down for various reasons. We now know tons of brands in the digital age as well, some of which have grown tremendously in the past few years, like Facebook, WordPress, Google, and more. Exactly what is branding, why do we need them, especially in today&#8217;s digital age, how do products and services become a great brand?</p>
<h2>What Is A Brand Anyway?</h2>
<p>A brand is an idea or a persona that customers or your target audiences associate with a product or service. The Brand Name, Logo or Slogan become stimulants for the identification of a brand created by any company or business.  Sometimes, brands are associated with simply the logo or the slogan that a company may build around a product or service.</p>
<p>But branding is much more than that. It is a differentiating factor between your products versus your competitor. It is also the entire persona that you build around your product or service. The image is a combination of symbols, references, and terms for customers to identify your product or service against others. Smaller elements like customer servicing scripts, colors used, and the kind of graphics you create to depict your brand, all add up to the persona of your product or service.</p>
<h2>Why Would You Need Branding?</h2>
<p>Branding your product and service is key to building trust and comfort in your audience to purchase from you rather than a competitor or an alternative. Branding gives you uniqueness and can build recognition amongst your audiences. With a stronger brand, you can add a premium to your pricing too, hence, you must need a good <a href="https://www.designrush.com/agency/logo-branding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">branding agency</a> for your business. Think big brands that you pay a premium for like Apple, or Rolls Royce. Consider it this way. Your brand can add great value to your company, over and above the physical assets and trademarks. For example, Coca-Cola&#8217;s brand value in 2014 was worth USD 67 million, which was more than 50% of the share&#8217;s value at that time!</p>
<p>For small businesses, a great brand can help with recognition and recall of your services and products. More so, it adds value to your business because of the trust factor that continues to build alongside a great brand. Great branding can add to referrals to your business too as customers talk about your brand in positive terms with others. Therefore, a strong brand can help you with adding significant value to your business.</p>
<h2>Key Ways to Build a Great Brand:</h2>
<p>To build a great brand think like the end customer. Identify the needs of your specific target audience that your brand will satisfy. The specific kind of thought, emotion, drive, and feeling that you want in your audience, is what your brand should stand out for and be about.</p>
<p>Here are some key ways of building a great brand in today’s competitive global marketplace:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define your Brand: Come up with at least 3-5 keywords that define your product instantly. Define the various thoughts and moods that your brand will stand out for. These thoughts and moods are represented by some of these elements. These elements invoke certain thoughts and emotions in the mind of the target audience:
<ul>
<li>Logo and its design concept</li>
<li>Colors that represent the feeling and emotions that you want to invoke in your audience</li>
<li>Values, references, and terms that your brand represents</li>
<li>Graphic elements and font styles that represent your brand</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Position your Brand: The specific target audience should be able to relate to your brand and should be able to engage with it. To position your brand, some key guidelines include:
<ul>
<li>Is your target audience able to relate to you and your brand?</li>
<li>Do they need to think about your brand to recall it?</li>
<li>Do they need to spend time and thought to be able to understand it?</li>
<li>Does your brand depict the uniqueness that you are offering in your products and services?</li>
<li>Is your brand able to reflect the values that you have planned out for your products and services to depict?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Be Consistent with your Brand: Once your brand name is in place, and you&#8217;ve decided on your positioning strategy, you should use it everywhere consistently. All print and digital communication should reflect the consistent communication of your brand. Inconsistent branding often results in low recognition, low demand, and confusion in the audience. If you are launching your online platforms, it is best to match your brand name with the web address you are opting for.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://zeracreative.com/branding-logo-design-company-pakistan/">Branding </a>your product is a one-time investment that pays dividends in the long run. It sets the tone right and reaches out to customers, one at a time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Small businesses and blogs often struggle in building a great blog audience who loves to read their work and avail their products and services. Larger businesses often market through mainstream media like television, print, billboards, and activations. Smaller businesses and blogs struggle in promoting their actionable content and their services or products to their audience. That is when <a href="https://zeracreative.com/">social media</a> steps in. There are some key ways to promote your business and your blog without having to break the bank!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4739 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-scaled.jpg" alt="12 Ways To Leverage Social Media And Build Blog Audience! - infographic 11 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1920" height="1301" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-scaled.jpg 1594w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-300x203.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-1024x694.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-768x520.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-1536x1041.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-2048x1388.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-960x651.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-600x407.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-944x640.jpg 944w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-800x542.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" title="12 Ways To Leverage Social Media And Build Blog Audience! 12"></p>
<h2>Start Your Promotion From Home</h2>
<p>More often than not, blogs and businesses come up with great services, solutions, products, and content. But it keeps sitting on the shelves or websites waiting for someone to show up. Promotion of the brand, however, starts from home. Bring out your social media profiles, and actively promote your services and posts with your friends and family. If they are part of the audience profile you came up with, then these are the first step towards building a blog audience. Even though sometimes, they may not share the same view of how great your brand is, or could be, building numbers on your blog, product or service, can help build a better word of mouth.</p>
<h2>Work On Your Personal Profile</h2>
<p>Build and perfect your own personal profile first. Share your business profile URLs within your own profile, populate your about us section with key details of your business, and mention the kind of products and services you offer. Your personal profile should be a visual landscape of your business so that people can relate you to your business easily. Even if you do not portray yourself as a brand or a person behind your brand, you can still mark the products and services on your personal profile, to denote your support for them. Promote key elements of your business and your blog on your personal profile to indicate your support as well.</p>
<h2>Start Building A Network</h2>
<p>Building a network online and offline can be key in generating leads, building a blog audience, and promoting your brand to your target audiences. Networking can help with recall as people start recognizing the brand. This brand recall can become stronger the more you participate online as well as offline in the communities where your target audiences are found. For example, there are several groups on LinkedIn, Facebook and communities across different forums where your target audiences may hang out. Work to build a strong network in these communities, by helping answer queries, talking to people in general, and communicating with the audiences.</p>
<h2>Participate In All The Right Places</h2>
<p>While networking would indicate hanging out where your audiences are, and getting to know them. Participation would often involve you to be in places that your audiences would be. For example, if your audience profile is such that they would be found amongst social media channels such as LinkedIn and Snapchat that most businesses never think about, then, by all means, participate and use these channels.  If you are actively participating in channels that are the right fit with your blog audience, then you can continue to reap benefits as more visitors come on to your website.</p>
<h2>Engage With Your Target Audience</h2>
<p>While engagement and networking on social media platforms will bring you most of your audience, you should also consider engaging with your target blog audience on other platforms and forums. Social Media is one key to the larger scheme of finding and collecting audience. Another key is finding the audience on forums and communities where engagement can be done through answering questions, posting questions, and sharing anecdotes and stories. With this engagement, your net worth is built and your expertise is highlighted. Quora is a general forum where all sort of audience is found. You can conduct a basic Google Search to find communities that resonate with your brand, to find more audiences there.</p>
<h2>Claim Your Name</h2>
<p>While social media can be a great audience builder, a key tip that most entrepreneurs fail to realize is that your name should be standard across all platforms. This includes your domain name, your social media channel names across different mediums, and your profiles. A singular name can help in finding your social media pages/profiles quickly rather than having to hunt through them. This can build familiarity amongst your audience for an easier transition from your social media page or profile to your website.</p>
<h2>Get Yourself Published</h2>
<p>Most small businesses have found their audiences and claim to fame, through getting published in larger publications. If you prefer to have your name out there amongst your key visitors, then aim to get published. Some key publications that take in articles from various bloggers and businesses include Huffington Post, Forbes, Inc.com, BuzzFeed, and more. You should also use mediums such as LinkedIn and Medium to build your and your brand&#8217;s online presence. It helps when a person searches out on the search engine and comes across details that build your online presence and display you as an expert or a knowledge leader in your field.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Forget Local Networking</h2>
<p>While most businesses work on building a seamless <a href="https://zeracreative.com/">social media</a> presence, local networking is often forgotten. A lot of your audience can come directly from word of mouth. Find out local networking groups, volunteering options, churches, and meetups that you can go to. These have people who are generally going to be like-minded. They will be more in tune based on the kind of audience profile you have created. These audiences can be a great boost in terms of word of mouth for your business as well as your blog.</p>
<h2>Get Your Business Cards Out</h2>
<p>Business cards are often the least used item in a small business or blog. But they can bring about a great boost to your blog if used in the right manner. A business card generally should contain social media channel IDs as well for the receiver to relate to your social media presence. Business cards can help you connect with your audience. They are a great help in brand recall when the receiver views the card again. Both physical and digital business cards can help in this case.</p>
<h2>Get Your Audience To Share</h2>
<p>Once your audience is visiting your blog or your website, the next step is to add options that allow your audience to share your goodness with the world. If you use a WordPress website, there are some key plugins that allow you to create toolbars for social media sharing. Similarly, for other websites built on other platforms, you can build social media sharing toolbars that allow your audience to share your posts, products or services on their profiles.</p>
<h2>Add Click to Tweet Options</h2>
<p>A key trick that quite a few blogs have used recently for good measure is the <a href="https://clicktotweet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click to Tweet</a> Option. You can also build this feature in your blog through plugins and codes. A specific phrase or sentence can be converted into a tweet and embedded into your content. The audience can readily share that piece on their Twitter profile by clicking on the Click To Tweet button. This way, your content is shared with the world, without significant effort from the audience itself. You can leverage social media profiles of your readers to get more audience onto your website this way.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Forget Lesser Used Channels</h2>
<p>More often than not, you can find your blog audience on social media channels that you may personally not be using. For example, some audience may be available on Pinterest, Instagram, Snapchat and LinkedIn. Usually, we may use these channels as a user but not as a small business owner or a blogger. However, these are great hubs to find great audience profiles and build your <a href="https://zeracreative.com/">social media</a> presence. For example, Pinterest is a key tool that a lot of people use to search for relevant content. You can leverage this idea by promoting your products, services and blog posts directly to your blog audience, on Pinterest boards for people to find, share and redirect to your <a href="https://zeracreative.com/">website</a>!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever attended a networking event and collected tons of paper business cards? In a week’s time, you realize you’ve forgotten half of those people you met or you’ve lost the cards. It is difficult to remember names or recall details of people when you meet them in a large networking event. The cost of getting cards printed, the effort of making the cards, all count too. More often than not, details of the business may change as well. How can one counter these elements and work with a business card, that would help people to remember you? The answer is, digital business cards!</p>
<h2>What Are Digital Business Cards?</h2>
<p>Digital contact cards are a new age concept where you can create your contact cards and portfolios online or an app. A variety of website and apps have cropped up that you can use to create a contact card that you can share with your colleagues. Newer versions have come up with greater options like location services, portfolio displays, and more. Unlike a traditional business card, digital cards can be flexible, so you can modify or change them whenever needed. Newer team members can be added, older ones can be phased out. If you have been considering rebranding, you can always modify your digital card easily without having to incur additional costs.</p>
<h2>Why Would You Need Digital Business Cards?</h2>
<p>Of course, traditional contact cards have a whole tradition behind them. In Japan, cards are normally presented with two hands. The tradition dictates that the chain of command is followed in both giving and receiving them. But, in our world, business card traditions are being rewritten every day.</p>
<p>If you thought, but I have always given out traditional business cards, why the sudden need for digital cards, then hear this out.</p>
<p>Digital cards help you cut costs, reduce the time to get them designed, and you can carry them around on your phone! No more forgetting to pick up your cards from the printer!</p>
<p>You may be questioning this debate, wondering how much you love your printed business cards. Then this is for all those people sitting on the fence in this debate!</p>
<p>Traditional business cards occupy space. The card is most likely to be thrown out if the recipient doesn&#8217;t need your service at the time. In that case, with a digital card, your contact details can be saved in the recipient&#8217;s phone. When you call or email them, they will recall who you are! That can be a major plus in the service industry.</p>
<p>Entering details from a traditional business card into a CRM can be painfully time-consuming. To counter that, digital cards can sync in quite easily.</p>
<p>Now, does that help win the argument for digital business cards?</p>
<h2>How To Create and Distribute Your Digital Business Cards?</h2>
<p>Digital business cards are easy to create and distribute. They can also be quite fun to create. For the millennials, students, and young entrepreneurs, they are a great option to use without having to spend time and cost in making physical cards.</p>
<p>For creatives and creative agencies, digital cards can be paired with social media presence and portfolios to give a great boost to business as well.</p>
<p>There are a few great options on how to use the digital world and distribute your digital cards:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use QR Codes: For those of you, who are still on the fence about moving to the darker side of digital business cards, you can use a QR Code on your card. A QR Code will save any data that you want it to capture, such as your website, your portfolio page, or your contact number and name.</li>
<li>Use a Digital Card Creation App: There are tons of apps available that can be used to create a digital business card. For example, some popular options include <a href="https://thehaystackapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haystack</a>, <a href="https://inigoapp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inigo</a>, <a href="http://www.snapdat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SnapDat</a>, <a href="https://www.camcard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CamCard</a>, and <a href="https://www.evaunt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eVaunt</a>. They all have various options like integration with SalesForce CRM, Google Map Integration and Mobile Apps for iPhone and Android. You can choose the one that best fits your need.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Things You Can Do With Digital Cards</h2>
<p>While traditional cards usually contain limited information, digital cards have a great many options for content that can be added. More than that, digital cards can give you a lot of features that you will not have with traditional cards.</p>

<ol>
<li>Add location details and integrate with Google Maps. Your contact card can go directly to Google Maps to show your card recipients, your address location</li>
<li>Integrate with your social media presence. Your audience can directly move to your social media pages from your business card</li>
<li>Link with your CRM. You can link the digital cards you receive, and the ones you create, directly to your CRM. That can reduce the amount of rework it would take to manually enter all your digital cards</li>
<li>Measure performance metrics. Your digital card can be a goldmine of information. With a traditional business card, you won&#8217;t know where it goes, and how many people contact you through your card. With your digital card, monitor the social media and website hits, to see what contact points are working for you best</li>
</ol>
<p>What works for you best, a traditional business card or a digital business card? Do share with us your comments and views.</p>

<p>We live in a world that is dominated by technology. The things we see, the work we do, and the way we interact with the things around us, are all impacted by technology. On one hand, where this huge inheritance of innovation is making lives more convenient, it is also opening up a higher level of clutter amongst organizations that revolve their businesses around these technologies.</p>
<p>The most recent innovation that is sweeping every industry off its feet is <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artificial Intelligence</a></strong>. While it has a been a while since AI made its arrival; it is now that every industry is actually embracing its potential.</p>
<p>Amongst all, the one industry that has one of the most customer-centric workings is E-Commerce. Many e-commerce businesses have already inculcated Artificial Intelligence in their organizations and are catering to better results.</p>
<p>In this blog, we have covered the influence of <strong>AI on e-commerce businesses</strong>, and the different ways in which organizations use it.</p>
<h2><strong>Defining the Concept of Artificial Intelligence</strong></h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence demonstrates the machines that are intelligent and capable enough to perform tasks and function on their own. The machines that assimilate AI are designed in a way that they can think and behave like a human.</p>
<p>This capability has given a rise to businesses in choosing to integrate with Artificial Intelligence, in order to enhance their overall efficiency and productivity. Over the years, the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/607716/worldwide-artificial-intelligence-market-revenues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">market for AI has seen a tremendous rise</a>; in 2016, the global market of AI was approximately worth 3,221 billion US dollars. As of 2025, it will reach approximately 89,847 billion US dollars.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4760 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infographic-21-scaled.jpg" alt="How is Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce? - infographic 21 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1920" height="1145" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infographic-21-scaled.jpg 1811w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infographic-21-300x179.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infographic-21-1024x611.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infographic-21-768x458.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infographic-21-1536x916.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infographic-21-2048x1222.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infographic-21-960x573.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infographic-21-600x358.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infographic-21-1073x640.jpg 1073w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infographic-21-800x477.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" title="How is Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce? 22"></p>
<h2><strong>Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>In the current scenario of the market where AI is bringing forth a lot of opportunities, being innovative is the key to success. The importance that this technology is getting has edged marketers to integrate AI into their business.</p>
<p>Following are some of the most common techniques in which <a href="/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>app development companies</strong></a> are making use of AI.</p>
<h3><strong>Using Chatbots</strong>:</h3>
<p>Over the years, there has been a rapid shift in the focus of businesses in regard to the users. Initially, it stood at catering to a bigger market, but it has now come to generate a great experience for the users. Many retailers have taken a better understanding of Artificial Intelligence and are incorporating techniques like Chatbots to improve the experience of users.</p>
<p>Now, what exactly is a Chatbot? In the most basic terms, a bot is a computer program that has been developed in a way that it indulges in conversations with the users in a completely human-like manner.</p>
<p>Big brands like H&amp;M, Amazon &amp; Walmart completely depend on chatbots for answering to the queries of the customers. Because the bots answer in a very conversational way (even though they are supposed to be mechanical), they have been gaining a lot of popularity. So much, so that when a user talks to the bot, it creates an illusion that a human is answering the queries!</p>
<p>Also, bots give very instant responses, eliminating the chances of users having to wait for a long period of time.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1933 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hm-chatbot.png" alt="How is Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce? - hm chatbot - Zera Creative" width="750" height="332" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hm-chatbot.png 750w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hm-chatbot-300x133.png 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hm-chatbot-600x266.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" title="How is Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce? 23"></p>
<p>Chatbots are connected with Artificial Intelligence and are hence trained to answer questions in the most relevant manner. It understands and learns from the interactions it has with users, stores them, and uses them to give answers in the future.</p>
<p>The best part about bots is that it not only improve the experience of users on the app, it is also increasing the productivity of the organization. Bots are efficiently saving the time of the employee who otherwise would have been delegated to respond to these queries of users!</p>
<h3><strong>Managing the inventory in organizations</strong>:</h3>
<p>The constant pain that employees face is keeping a track of everything in an organization. Be it as small as a pin, you will have to keep the inventory up to date. The predictive nature of Artificial Intelligence has taken care of managing the inventory!</p>
<p>Based on the working of AI, it collects and analyses the important factors that drive the demand for major requirements in the market, predicts what their future demands would be, and that gives the organizations a benefit in knowing their inventory needs!</p>
<h3><strong>Easier customer searches:</strong></h3>
<p>If we look at it from the perspective of the users, it is very difficult to find the exact thing that you are looking for. Of course, users can spend hours on search engines trying to find what they are looking for, but the chances of coming across that exact thing are slight.</p>
<p>Thanks to the tech-friendly world we are living in, Artificial Intelligence has the perfect solution for this! AI assists the customers in finding what they were looking for in a much more natural way.</p>
<p>Take for instance, in the app <a href="https://www.gofind.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go Find</a>, you can take a picture of whatever you like. The app will bring similar-looking results from its stores.</p>
<p>The Echo Look by Amazon uses a camera integrated with Artificial Intelligence. It gives recommendations about what looks best on the user!</p>
<p>The whole concept of AI is eliminating the need for typing search words to look for something. It is now shifting to using visuals to complete that task, making the process more interesting.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1936 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/artificial-intelligence-impacting-e-commerce-go-find-visual-fashion-search.jpg" alt="How is Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce? - artificial intelligence impacting e commerce go find visual fashion search - Zera Creative" width="750" height="320" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/artificial-intelligence-impacting-e-commerce-go-find-visual-fashion-search.jpg 750w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/artificial-intelligence-impacting-e-commerce-go-find-visual-fashion-search-300x128.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/artificial-intelligence-impacting-e-commerce-go-find-visual-fashion-search-600x256.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" title="How is Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce? 24"></p>
<h3><strong>Create an interactive sales process</strong>:</h3>
<p>Given the high level of competition in every domain today, it is pretty difficult to reach out to the customers and offer them the most appropriate services. Which is why the integration of Artificial Intelligence in managing the customers’ time efficiently. It understands the choices of the users before providing any customized solutions.</p>
<p>Also, it deploys the time of the users only in the areas required. It also ensures that they don’t see any inappropriate products. For instance, The North Face uses “IBM Watson”. It asks the users choice-related questions like “Where will you be using the jacket?”. Based on the answers, it brings forth the most relevant products.</p>
<h3><strong>Channeling a new level of personalization</strong>:</h3>
<p>Regardless of who the user is or what they want, they would want a personalized experience on the app. Rather than generalizing the needs of the users, the algorithms of Artificial Intelligence can be utilized to cater the personalized content for the users. That would give them a better and more optimized experience.</p>
<p>This can be illustrated by an example; suppose a user is browsing for a superhero tee on a website from their laptop. Now, they can receive advertisements about any offers or sales related to that search when they open any social media platform (eg. Facebook, Instagram) from their mobile phone as well.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1935 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Artificial-Intelligence-Impacting-E-Commerce.jpg" alt="How is Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce? - Artificial Intelligence Impacting E Commerce - Zera Creative" width="750" height="400" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Artificial-Intelligence-Impacting-E-Commerce.jpg 750w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Artificial-Intelligence-Impacting-E-Commerce-300x160.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Artificial-Intelligence-Impacting-E-Commerce-600x320.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" title="How is Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce? 25"></p>
<h3><strong>Virtual assistants</strong>:</h3>
<p>Being a part of the tech world has accustomed us to expect a higher level of convenience with every new technology that envelopes us. The concept of Virtual Assistants like Siri &amp; Alexa has opened up new opportunities for users.</p>
<p>They are already impacting the way users do their purchasing. By helping out in practically every task that users perform on a website or app, virtual assistants have made e-commerce a successful domain.</p>
<p>Right from navigating the users from one location on the app to another, to finding something for them, to placing their order, the integration of virtual assistants has reached the next level!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1934" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/artificial-intelligence-integrating-e-commerce-alexa-siri.png" alt="How is Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce? - artificial intelligence integrating e commerce alexa siri - Zera Creative" width="750" height="375" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/artificial-intelligence-integrating-e-commerce-alexa-siri.png 750w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/artificial-intelligence-integrating-e-commerce-alexa-siri-300x150.png 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/artificial-intelligence-integrating-e-commerce-alexa-siri-600x300.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" title="How is Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce? 26"></p>
<h2><strong>Biggest Brands using Artificial Intelligence</strong></h2>
<p>Quite often, we stumble upon engaging with brands that are revolving their entire businesses around the domain of Artificial Intelligence. One of the primary reasons why they are succeeding today is because of their inclination towards this innovation!</p>
<p>Check out some of the biggest e-commerce brands that integrated with Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amazon</strong>: Amazon is probably the biggest name whose sales have reached the sky because of indulging in AI. Alexa, which is <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa?cid=a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon’s cloud-based voice service</a>, customers can interact with the technology that they use every day.<br />
Other than this, Amazon also introduced “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=16008589011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Go</a>”. It is a tech-based shopping store. Customers can enjoy their shopping experience simply by using the Amazon Go app when they get into the store.</li>
<li><strong>Alibaba:</strong> Alibaba launched Tmall Genie; it performs tasks like controlling the smart home devices, checking the weather, or monitoring the user’s daily routine schedule. Alibaba also possesses its own chatbot, <a href="http://www.alizila.com/online-merchants-deploy-alibabas-ai-customer-service-chatbot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ali Xiaomi</a> (Ali Assistant) that answers both written and spoken queries.</li>
<li><strong>eBay</strong>: eBay is one of the first companies to step in the e-commerce business. It is now integrating with AI to have an edge over competitors! eBay uses its bot, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/18/the-new-shopbot-bot-on-messenger-searches-ebay-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eBay Shopbot</a>, which users can access through Facebook Messenger. The bot works as an assistant and assists users in performing tasks on the app.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>There is no doubt in understanding that every facet of Artificial Intelligence is empowering the way e-commerce businesses are functioning. AI is no longer in its infant phase. Its scope has expanded and is envisioned to grow further in the near future.</p>
<p>As an enterprise, if you wish to survive in this highly competitive market, the time for investing in AI is here!</p>
<p>The way AI has emerged is completely changing the paradigm of how businesses manage customer service. It is both helping and transforming the interactions that take place between businesses and customers.

The website can also include a soothing background music and pictures of the staff and happy customers. Contact details and address are obviously a must!</p>
<h2><b>Social Networks</b></h2>
<p>Once your website is up and running, the next digital media sector that you should target are the social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest etc. Take a look at the existing pages of beauty salons across the nation and in your city. A fun and interactive page are what is required to be maintained. For example, regular tweets with latest fashion and beauty related topics can be uploaded to Twitter &amp; Pinterest.</p>
<h2>Use Facebook’s Potential</h2>
<p>Facebook is an excellent forum for promotion and marketing because of its multiple interactive features. Regular updates about client sessions (satisfied customers will be more than happy to pose for a picture) in the salon can be done by your employees. Professionalism needs to be maintained. Uploading pictures or videos of the latest trends in beauty, makeup, hairstyles, fashion and related areas will keep the interest of the page visitors active.</p>
<h2>Interactive Sessions</h2>
<p>Interactive sessions with your stylists can be arranged on any social media site wherein the clients can directly chat with your stylists and clear their doubts. Also, special offers or coupons can be given out especially for your Facebook fans or Twitter followers.</p>
<h2>Online Appointments</h2>
<p>The option of setting up an appointment online should be made available on all these forums.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">The fashion industry is big and booming today with numerous fashion enthusiasts taking to the Internet to spread the word about their business and to attract customers.</p>
<p>If you would like your fashion business to do better than your competitors you have to do things either differently or better than them. Keep in mind that competition is fierce and over the web, you are competing at an international level. This is the reason why you should do everything in your power to excel.</p>
<p>The good news here is that even though the Internet has increased competition, it has given us easier and quicker ways to beat the competition. One such blessing is social media. Fashionistas are all over social media to promote themselves because this powerful tool can indeed spin wonders.</p>
<p>However, social media is beneficial only when you appreciate its potential and use it accordingly. We have for you a few tips that will enable you to optimize your business using social media:</p>

<h2>Use Pictures</h2>
<p>In the fashion world, it is all about visuals. That is why you should establish your presence on social media platforms that are specifically for pictures. These include Pinterest and Instagram. Both these portals are all about pictures and are the best for a fashion business. Of course, you may use Facebook and Twitter but even on these portals, it is advised that you speak through pictures and limit text.</p>
<h2>Customize Your Messages</h2>
<p>It is totally unacceptable to upload the same message on all social media portals. This is because your followers on Twitter have a completely different train of thought when compared to your followers on Instagram. On Twitter, you will see people who are more into technology while Facebook is for everyone. Instagram is specifically for those who love sharing images, as is Pinterest. This is why you should segment your messages based on the platform you are using. Generic messages will not appeal to everyone.</p>
<h2>Establish A Connection</h2>
<p>On social media, direct promotion of your fashion business will not help you at all. Social media is a portal to share information and to connect first. Only then should you think of promoting yourself. Also, the promotion should be discreet. Your focus should be on establishing a connection with your audience by narrating stories about lifestyle. You may also get in touch with your customers to share their stories.</p>
<p>Most of them will be happy to do so. When you share these stories you will attract others as well. You also have the option of creating suggestive, beautiful stories of lifestyle that may appeal to your target audience.</p>
<h2>Retarget Your Visitor With Facebook Ads To Increase Conversion Rates</h2>
<p>Most people are not ready to buy immediately upon seeing an ad or visiting your website. With retargeting you’re able to reach the same people that were thinking about buying your product with reminder ads.</p>
<p>You can retarget visitors to your website by creating <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-website-custom-audiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Custom Audiences</a> with Facebook (with just a snippet of code), and target <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-website-custom-audiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lookalike Audiences</a> as well to expand your reach.</p>
<p>If they don’t purchase—let’s say after a week—you can give them a slight discount in the ad to get them to act. Retargeting people who have abandoned their shopping cart is also a fantastic way to generate sales that otherwise would have been lost.</p>

<h2>Create Style Guides</h2>
<p>Create style guides to show your visitors how to wear or incorporate your items into their everyday life.</p>
<p>If you own a fashion brand that sells a variety of clothing items, put together a style guide for your website so that visitors and subscribers can get ideas on how to wear your clothing, and even incorporate pieces into their existing wardrobe.</p>
<p>Don’t limit yourself to just one guide. Style guides can be done seasonally (spring, summer, fall, winter), for special occasions (wedding, party, picnic), holidays (Eid, Christmas, New Year’s), and for more topical themes: travel, work, weekend, beach.</p>
<p>Here is the great example of one of our client: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/closetfashionpk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Closet Fashion</a><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1456 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/closet-fashion-instagram.png" alt="Best Tips to Generate More Customers from Social Media For Fashion Business - closet fashion instagram - Zera Creative" width="890" height="522" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/closet-fashion-instagram.png 890w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/closet-fashion-instagram-300x176.png 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/closet-fashion-instagram-768x450.png 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/closet-fashion-instagram-600x352.png 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/closet-fashion-instagram-800x469.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px" title="Best Tips to Generate More Customers from Social Media For Fashion Business 33"></p>
<p>Guides can be listed as a special section on your website and incorporated into your blog or Instagram, where you can provide more in-depth information on each item in the collection. Try telling a story with the style guide to interest your customer.</p>
<h2>Work With Influencers</h2>
<p>Yes, work with influencers in your category to provide you with access to a new audience, gain social proof, and receive unique content.</p>
<p>To get in front of your ideal audience, work with a popular fashion vlogger or blogger that already has a dedicated following of people who would like your brand. Those with large audiences have built a reputation and are well respected by their readers. They can have a huge impact if they choose to mention, review, or even wear your products. <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7222" src="https://uhurunetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fashion-Digital-Marketing-to-increase-sales.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="https://uhurunetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fashion-Digital-Marketing-to-increase-sales.jpg 300w, https://uhurunetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fashion-Digital-Marketing-to-increase-sales-150x150.jpg 150w, https://uhurunetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fashion-Digital-Marketing-to-increase-sales-299x300.jpg 299w" alt="Fashion Digital Marketing to Increase Sales" width="300" height="301" title="Best Tips to Generate More Customers from Social Media For Fashion Business 34"></p>
<p>You can work with them to create content around a specific campaign or just create gorgeous images with your product. Their influence and creative take on your product will garner great interaction and sales.</p>
<p>Working with bloggers gives you two huge things: you get in front of a new audience and, if you selected the correct influencer, then you’ll gain new customers and the blogger will create content for you. Depending on the collaboration, they will share custom content on their blog, and social channels, and you (the brand) may also get the opportunity to use the content they produce.</p>
<p>When collaborating with a blogger, you can also run Facebook ads featuring the photos of the bloggers to send traffic their way, and in turn, get your product(s) noticed. (Make sure you get a signed agreement before posting images of them and/or their logo.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PRO TIP</strong>: When working with bloggers, provide a brand guide so you give them more guidance and they create the content you’re looking for.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Do Not Try Too Hard</h2>
<p>The more you push, the harder you will fall. This is the mantra on social media. Do not force yourself on social media or push on your customers to buy from you. Keep it interactive and simple, full of colorful images that will attract your target audience. All the content, visual or textual, should be relevant, decent, and interesting.</p>
<blockquote><p>Social media is extremely powerful, especially for the fashion business. Use it to the fullest so that your business sees a boost.</p></blockquote>
