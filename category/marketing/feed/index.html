										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The company profile is a short description of your business. It&#8217;s a way to introduce your company and its products or services to the world, helping people understand what you do and how they can get in touch with you. You can use it as an opportunity to build trust with clients who don&#8217;t know much about you yet, or even as an opportunity for them to learn more about who they&#8217;re buying from.</p>
<p>Company profiles are also good for marketing purposes: by showing off what makes your enterprise unique (or similar), potential clients will be more likely to open up about their needs—and that&#8217;s when sales come in!</p>
<p>A company profile can be written in a number of different ways. You could write it yourself or hire someone to do it for you. The most important thing is that there must be consistency between all of your company profiles so that people know what they are buying when they look at one website or another.</p>
<h2>Benefits of a Company Profile </h2>
<p>Company profile is important for large as well as for small businesses that want to grow fast. It helps you stand out from the competition, attract new customers and build trust with your existing ones. The pursuing are some of the advantages;</p>
<ul>
<li>It serves as a great marketing tool</li>
<li>Helps your company stand out</li>
<li>Builds brand awareness &#038; credibility</li>
<li>Gives a sentiment about your products and services</li>
<li>Helps in the recruitment process</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use a company profile to increase sales by <a href="https://www.digitaltrails.co.uk/10-steps-to-create-and-maintain-a-positive-brand-image/" target="_blank" title="company profile design service" rel="noopener">creating a positive brand image</a> for your business. This will help customers choose products or services from you over competitors because they know that what you sell is good quality or genuine in nature.</p>
<p>You can use the company profile as a marketing tool to attract more customers by displaying information about how much money was spent on advertising campaigns, how many people attended events etc., which shows them how committed these companies are toward their customers’ satisfaction levels (and thus increases chances of making repeat purchases).</p>
<h2>How to Create a Company Profile</h2>
<p>A company profile is a summary of your business. It should be short and concise, clear and easy to understand, and have a good visual design. The information you provide should be up-to-date at all times so that potential customers can see what you are offering right now in the marketplace as well as look forward to future plans.</p>
<p>A company profile should be written in simple English text with no technical terms or jargon. The graphics and images used in the company profile must be top-notch with attention to detail. It should not be overly long as it will not be read by many people including potential customers or clients who might contact you for services or products. </p>
<p>If possible, try to use an even amount of slides, images, and text so that there is sufficient room for other important information such as contact details and website URL address, etc.</p>

<h2>Pros and Cons of a Company Profile </h2>
<p>A company profile is a document that outlines the history of a company and its mission. It&#8217;s often used by potential investors or business partners to get an idea of what a company does and how it works. A company profile can also be used as an example for writing other kinds of documentation, like blog posts, press releases, or marketing collateral.</p>
<h3>Pros </h3>
<p>A company profile is a summary of your company&#8217;s values and goals, as well as its mission. It should be easy to read, but also provide details about what you&#8217;re passionate about as an organization and what makes you special. A good company profile will show that you understand your target audience—which is why it&#8217;s so important for businesses that want to stand out in their field!</p>
<h3>Pros </h3>
<p>Some people may not like the idea of a company profile. It can be hard to keep up with the latest news and developments, especially if you&#8217;re not involved in the industry. The process of creating a company profile can be time-consuming, so if you&#8217;re looking for something quick and easy, this might not be for you. Creating a company profile is expensive—you&#8217;ll need someone who has expertise in writing about businesses or startups (or both) who will charge per hour based on their estimate of how long it takes them to complete each task they are asked to do by your organization(s).</p>
<h2>Is a Company Profile Really Important for a Business? </h2>
<p><strong>The answer is yes</strong>, a company profile is really important for a business.</p>
<p>A company profile can be a tool to tell people about your business, it helps you to build trust with your customers and it helps you stand out from the competition. This will attract more potential clients who are looking for something different than what they have already seen on other websites or social media platforms.</p>
<p>Company profile is really important for small businesses that want to grow fast. It helps potential customers to understand your company and product better, build trust with them, create brand awareness and grow your business.</p>
<p>When having a company profile on LinkedIn, helps people find out more about you so that they can get in touch with you if they have any questions or need assistance with something corresponding to what you do.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We hope this blog has made you understand the importance of a company profile and how to build one. The next step is to start <a href="https://zeracreative.com/company-profile-writing-designing-company-pakistan/" title="company profile design service">designing your company profile</a>, but it’s a good idea to keep these tips in mind while you do so. Remember, your profile is a reflection of what kind of business you’re running and what service you&#8217;re offering.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It doesn’t matter how thorough and well-researched your content is, if it cannot follow On-Page SEO guidelines, it would never disrupt fierce competition. And, would never see limelight aka cement top places on SERPs.</p>
<p>Heck, not even be read by the target audience as the content pieces would be far away from page 1 … and as a result, your content would keep on piling up dust and nothing else.</p>
<p>That’s why no website can afford to not implement On-Page SEO tactics that pronounce its authority to search engines. So search engines could rank it better than competitors and show it to the mass audience.</p>
<p>This article intends to dispense some highly valuable On-Page SEO strategies that will help better your rankings. The strategies we’re going to show you are quite useful that even <a title="SEO gurus in Pakistan" href="https://zeracreative.com/seo-company-pakistan/">SEO gurus</a> would hoard from you so they can sell their course…</p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s get into the nuts and bolts…</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4743 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-scaled.jpg" alt="Secrets to Nail On-Page SEO (That SEO Gurus Won’t Tell) - infographic 13 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1594" height="1080" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-scaled.jpg 1594w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-300x203.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-1024x694.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-768x520.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-1536x1041.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-2048x1388.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-960x651.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-600x407.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-944x640.jpg 944w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-800x542.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1594px) 100vw, 1594px" title="Secrets to Nail On-Page SEO (That SEO Gurus Won’t Tell) 3"></p>
<h2>Snippet Optimization</h2>
<p>In 2022 snippet optimization is HUGE.</p>
<p>No blog should be without snippet optimization because regardless of your position in Google SERPs … Google shows your content on top of every other content for a particular keyword if it was optimized for that keyword.</p>
<p>What it means, you gain Zero Position on Google SERPs well above any ranked website, if you optimized snippets better than them. Isn’t it fascinating?</p>
<p>There are two ways to do so,</p>
<p><strong>1. Write a helpful answer paragraph that gives a quick solution to the readers.</strong></p>
<p>Since Google values its users, it would pick up on the on-point answer as a standalone so users don’t have to wrap their heads around it to get the answer.</p>
<p>And if users want to go in-depth to understand the base of your answer, they can open the link and read it through. It’s so huge that now every single company that understands Google&#8217;s algorithm and criticality to win Zero Position is now focusing on optimizing snippets that show in the Google search.</p>
<p><strong>2.HTML headings are another way to win snippet competition, provided that the headings are relevant to the search query.</strong></p>
<p>Google picks up on these when a paragraph isn’t enough to answer the search query. Like “7 Methods to perform SEO research” or “How to set up your WordPress website” Logically speaking, it would be impossible for a blog creator to cram everything into a single paragraph.</p>
<p>Also, Google knows that the answer to such questions must be thorough, and step by step like a process. So your content must have relevant HTML Headings to be picked by Google as featured snippets.</p>
<p>However, there is other critical and technical info related to snippet optimization like, when to write an answer so Google can pick it up easily, what should be the length of the answer and where to place it in the text body.</p>
<p>To nail it with perfection, you can <a href="/contact">get back to us and we will hook you up</a>.</p>
<h2>Content Relevance Reigns Supreme</h2>
<p>Gone are the days when bloggers would stuff keywords throughout the content to fake search engines and acquire top most places. Now Google and their AI got advanced enough that they no longer facilitate such shady practices of ranking content.</p>
<p>So to rank the content above competitors, the content must have relevance and solve customer queries. We can’t emphasize enough on this.</p>
<p>Google now has changed a fair fit that it only allows genuine content creators that come up with unique content that ticks with readers to rule the SERPs.</p>
<p>The result of this advancement favours top content creators that cater to the relevance and buckle down those content creators that only produce the rehashed version of what’s already been on the web.</p>
<p>So for you to outrank competitors, it’s fantastically critical to producing genuine content that intends to solve readers’ problems. If you satisfy the reader to the core and make them stick around till the end, Google will pick this up and boost your rankings.</p>
<h2>Internal Linking for SEO Optimization</h2>
<p>Internal linking passes on link juice to all the content it’s linked to. This’s a bit technical but would benefit you a lot. Let’s make it simple for you…</p>
<p>OK! So you have a few content pieces that attract eyeballs for all the good reasons and generate a heck of load lot of traffic. But you figure out that the other content pieces aren’t getting as meaningful results as much as you’d hoped for.</p>
<p>In this case, you can link the already ranked posts to the other low-performed posts. That helps pass on a bit of credibility to low-performing posts. Isn&#8217;t it amazing?</p>
<p>Oh… and should I tell you another heck? When companies create a product page/service page they include links to the top-performing content that redirect to that product page.</p>
<p>Which helps them gain link juice and helps improve its overall ranking. Companies keep generating content around the service/product page for that same matter.</p>
<p>However, the relevance of the surrounding contents determines the performance of the directed page. That is the easiest way to improve rankings of your non-performing content by linking to it from high-performing content.</p>
<h2>Outbound Links for On-Page Optimization</h2>
<p>Outbound links are the links that you plug into your content pieces that direct to the authoritative websites.</p>
<p>Websites that have high <a title="Domain Authority (DA) and high Page Authority (PA)" href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/domain-authority" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Domain Authority (DA) and high Page Authority (PA)</a>. These links are vital for Web crawlers to adjudge your content’s authority.</p>
<p>What it means, when you link to credible resources to back up your claims, Google crawlers will follow it and pass on the signal of authority. By authority means, the content you put on is backed up by authoritative data, which increases the legitimacy of your claims.</p>
<p>So, the websites could be Government owned like. .gov or Institutional owned like PubMed etc. So, in the nerve-wracking and palm-sweating competition, outbound links play their vital role.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, finding websites that improve your authority over time is a daunting process and can eat up your time and energy…<br />
The best plot is to <a href="/contact">let us assist you</a> in doing the whole darn thing.</p>
<h2>White Spacing</h2>
<p>You have read it this far… Why? Because you’ve found the content <em>palatable</em>.</p>
<p>If we cramped the whole darn concept without spacing or putting up headings, and breaking up sentences, you wouldn’t mind shutting down the content before reading a single paragraph, let alone read it this far.</p>
<p>What that says is always make use of white spacing (though don’t overdo that). White spacing isn&#8217;t rocket science, simply break up sentences and paragraphs into one or 2 lines.</p>
<p>So the readers feel at ease reading the content without giving themselves a headache. I got it, but what does it have to do with Page SEO?</p>
<p>Smart question! If your readers bounced off without reading till the end, Google picks up on that and terms your content not worthy to the readers. Consequently, Google will push your content down in the rankings.</p>
<p>So white spacing to give breathers to the readers’ eyes is an extremely useful strategy to boost rankings.</p>
<h2>Optimized Images</h2>
<p>Never make the banal mistake of not optimizing images. The ALT text you write for images is picked up by Google, which further propounds to Google what the content is about. The secret to writing ALT text is to write short, punchy, to the point, yet effective and meaningful text.</p>
<p>Text that gives off the exact meanings that you want to convey through your content. The text could be termed as the sum up the context of what you want to portray through content.</p>
<p>The point is always to make sure to optimize images with text that could help boost rankings.</p>
<h2>URL Optimization</h2>
<p>Make sure that the URL link must not as long as your title. And just focus on conveying the gist of the matter in two to three words. For example, for content heading like “7 methods to perform content audit”, the URL mustn’t be this long.</p>
<p>It should be something like www.yourwebsitename.com/content-audit</p>
<p>It helps in two ways; you make it simple for Google to understand what the content is about in less space. Second, you might want to expand your content to 11 methods or could be 21 methods; so you don’t always change the URL.</p>
<p>Since it probably is linked to other resources, and doing so generates 404 errors. You would want to avoid that as it’s not fruitful for your rankings.</p>
<h2>Wrap Up</h2>
<p>Now you’ve learned masterful tricks on how to perform On-Page SEO and jack up your chances to boost organic rankings.</p>
<p>The next thing you need to do is implement them to the tee. Which is a bit of a tedious process if you haven’t done it before. Plus, it might overwhelm you since you already have too much on your plate to handle.</p>
<p>In which case, you can <a href="https://zeracreative.com/best-seo-company-in-karachi/">reach us out</a> and we’ll be happy to assist. However, if you decide to implement them on your own, make sure to cater to all the above tricks to nail on-page SEO.</p>

<h2>1. Google AutoSuggestion or Google Soup Method</h2>
<p>Over the years several tools have been introduced to help you find most searchable keywords.</p>
<p>But the fact is, none of the tools are as accurate as the mighty <strong>GOOGLE</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes! All such tools give you a ballpark analysis on certain statistics, which are sometimes accurate and other times – well, wayward. So solely relying on them is like living in a man-made paradise.</p>
<p>No! It isn’t like we outright eliminate paid tools; not at all.</p>
<p>The point is, none of the tools are as accurate as GOOGLE itself.</p>
<p>When someone is typing keywords in Google search bar, as they are typing, Google shows them different variations based around keywords to make it easy for users to find the relevant content they are looking after.</p>
<p>Google itself did not whip these related searches, Google has picked them up based on what people are searching the most.<br />
You as a business owner doing your own SEO can look up in Google search and find keywords through Google Soup method or autosuggestion method.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s see an example of it,</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you type in <strong>“Weight loss”</strong>, Google would show you some variations of this keyword.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-3779" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo.png" alt="How to do Keyword Research for SEO" width="500" height="" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo.png 321w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo-300x300.png 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 321px) 100vw, 321px" title="How to do Keyword Research for SEO (Detailed Guide) 9"></p>
<p>That means you have more keywords that people are searching at your disposal to create content around.</p>
<p>Wait… Before we discuss our next amazing method, Shouldn’t we dispense another cool hack to further leverage Google auto research?</p>
<p>There you go,</p>
<p>You can find more variations to the primary keyword by typing some question words before the keyword,</p>
<blockquote><p>Such as why, when, how, what, which, etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>This will give you more content ideas to create content around.</p>
<p>Isn’t it exceptional?</p>
<p>I won’t go to the next step until I fill you up with everything you should know about Google autosuggestion.</p>
<p>Here’s another cool method to find question based keywords by peeping into related questions.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-3780" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo-guide.png" alt="How to do Keyword Research for SEO" width="500" height="" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo-guide.png 375w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo-guide-300x274.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" title="How to do Keyword Research for SEO (Detailed Guide) 10"></p>
<p>See, these are most searched questions based around the primary keyword we typed.</p>
<p>Dammit, you now have more keywords at your disposal…</p>
<p>Don’t you think this tactic will give you a plethora of keywords? That you can leverage to make 1 year worth content.</p>
<p>However, sometimes (rarely though) you might feel stalled finding keywords with this method.</p>
<p>No problem! We have other tools in our toolkit to help you out…</p>
<p>BTW, one thing to keep in mind that the process isn’t like snapping fingers, it would take you hours and sometimes days to find <strong>hidden gems</strong> from trenches.</p>
<p>However, we have a <a href="https://zeracreative.com/best-seo-company-in-karachi/"><em><strong>dedicated SEO team</strong></em></a> who can do this for you.</p>
<h2>2. Steal your Competitors Keywords</h2>
<p>Don’t shit at me for saying this.</p>
<p>I’m not coaxing you to steal anything illegal.</p>
<p>Instead, I’m telling you to be a street smart cookie to shorten your learning curve.</p>
<p>Having said that, competitive analysis is the surefire way to hack what’s working in the industry.</p>
<p>Your competitors had wrapped their brains around and gone through a rigorous and dreadful process to find highly relevant keywords that solve readers’ problems</p>
<p>What if you played smart enough and discerned the reasons behind what’s currently working for your competitors?</p>
<p>That would set the stage for you to optimize content to not only attract relevant audience but also outsmart competitors by further embellishing content.</p>
<p>This process saves your time and energy and confers you keywords that can make you money.</p>
<p><strong>Here are 2 Free ways you can use to perform Competitive Analysis</strong></p>
<h3>1. Moz Keyword Explorer</h3>
<p><a href="https://moz.com/explorer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moz’s free tool</a> gives you the luxury to peep into competitors&#8217; keywords by typing in competitors&#8217; root domain in the search bar and smack search option.</p>
<p>The result will pop up that gives you a list of 50 top ranking pages of your competitor&#8217;s website with statistics on search volume, keyword difficulty and more.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that a free account only caters to 10 entries per/month. To have more, you need to upgrade the account.</p>
<h3>2. Uber Suggest By Neil Patel</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tool </a>precisely helps you if you want to know the country wise traffic sources, keyword difficulty, and estimated volume for every word.</p>
<p>The country specific data is especially useful when your target audience belongs to a particular area you want to target.<br />
Like Moz’s explorer this tool only provides you a certain number of keywords for free.</p>
<p>What if I gave you the 3rd way of doing competitive analysis?</p>
<p>Here you have…</p>
<p><strong>Through Google Search</strong></p>
<p>Ohh!!! Again Google…?</p>
<p>Well, you can’t keep master at bay, can you?</p>
<p>You can simply type in competitors’ domain in Google search bar, like this</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-3781" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo-example.png" alt="How to do Keyword Research for SEO" width="668" height="725" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo-example.png 668w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo-example-276x300.png 276w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo-example-600x651.png 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo-example-590x640.png 590w" sizes="(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px" title="How to do Keyword Research for SEO (Detailed Guide) 11"></p>
<p>You see, the results that come against the search that has <strong>“paleo diet”</strong> as keywords.</p>
<p>So you can simply plug in competitors&#8217; domains with any keyword to know whether they optimize the keyword.</p>
<h3>3. Google Trends for Keyword Research</h3>
<p>We apologize for bringing Google again in our conversation.</p>
<p>We can’t just help myself not to include Google in this topic</p>
<p>Anyway, Google trends tell you what’s trending related to your topic.</p>
<p>This gives you an opportunity to jump in and produce content around what’s currently hot in your market.</p>
<p>You can find trending topics by typing abroad keyword.</p>
<p>These insights allow you to jump on any hot topic that could bring an influx of traffic to your website for all the good reasons.</p>
<p><strong>A caveat:</strong> Don’t get tricked into creating content around hot topics that don’t fit into your strategy…</p>
<p><strong>By the way, if you have any issue with forming an <a href="https://zeracreative.com/best-seo-company-in-karachi/"><strong>SEO strategy</strong></a> that aligns with your business goals; we’re <a href="https://zeracreative.com/contact/">here to help</a> you out.</strong></p>
<h3>4. Reddit, Quora, and Niche Forums</h3>
<p>Do you know which is an online goldmine for research?</p>
<p>Yup! You guessed it right…</p>
<blockquote><p>Reddit, Quora and all industry specific forums</p></blockquote>
<p>Where else could you find people writing out their concerns and issues?</p>
<p>Because of the like-mindedness, people post questions about their problems with no hesitation or second thought, and members of the community sincerely try to solve their issues to the best of their abilities.</p>
<p>Here’s your chance to find out what most people are asking, or what bugs them the most?</p>
<p>This gives a sneak into their problem, which you can solve through your content.</p>
<p>Does that WOW you?</p>
<p>I guess so. The last method of doing keyword research isn’t much different either.</p>
<h3>5. Leverage social media for Keyword Research</h3>
<p>Social media is a place to have fun, but ONLY for common people.</p>
<p>Not harried business professionals like you.</p>
<p>Like Forums, <a href="https://zeracreative.com/12-ways-to-leverage-social-media-and-build-blog-audience/">social media</a> can be a potent way to find relevant keywords straight from the audience’s mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Well, there’re gazillion ways to do that…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can leverage the power of <strong>#Hashtags</strong> on <strong>instagram </strong>and <strong>Twitter </strong>to find keywords.</li>
<li>Follow professionals for <strong>linkedin </strong>to analyze topics they are discussing fervently.</li>
<li>Be on Niche Specific <strong>Fb groups</strong> with activity. You will get to see people blabbing about their problems.</li>
<li><strong>Youtube Trending</strong> content to figure out the ongoing trends</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wrap Up</h2>
<p>There you have it… I’m pretty sure that based on these unique and proven methods you’d be able to find niche specific keywords and create mouthwatering and jaw dropping content around.</p>
<p>However, these methods can be time taking.</p>
<p>It might take hours and days to keep the search going before you could find keywords and topics to create content around.</p>
<p>And as a professional, you may not have time for all this.</p>
<p>This’s where we step in to find high traffic, less competitive and lead pulling keywords to capitalize on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Becoming a <a href="https://zeracreative.com/wordpress-development-company/">WordPress </a>user is the first step towards promotion of an idea, conceived by you. You may simply call it a blog, a personal page, or the platform from where you promote other people as well. In comparison to other blog hosting websites, the variety of choices offered by WordPress is immense. Yet the basic output is to put your idea on web display much in the same way as the wise words say:</p>
<blockquote><p>putting it on the paper</p></blockquote>
<p>That particular <strong>‘paper’</strong> has transformed itself into software with many interactive options. Most users enact their WordPress blog considering it to be the final representation of their idea in the world of <a href="https://zeracreative.com/web-hosting-service-in-karachi-pakistan/">web hosting</a> but many others consider it to be the first step towards the development of a website later on.</p>
<p>Many more choices can be taken up when you are finding an aim for your idea depending upon the genre of it. Here the emphasis must remain upon moving on towards better and bigger website software tools for blog development and domain hosting as well. Most users languish in the thin space between the WordPress blog and its successful promotion. This area in particular banishes most blog stories into an unsuccessful realm.</p>
<p><strong>What are the required tools to make that blog a success? </strong> The answer varies from the simplicity of available options to the adoption of better and bigger software techniques. Social media promotion can be considered to be the basis of a successful blog or website. It can be based on an entrepreneurial, food, fashion, or digital marketing idea. Social media promotion can give it the required boost.</p>
<p><a href="https://zeracreative.com/social-media-management-services-in-karachi-pakistan/"><strong>Social media promotion</strong></a> is often restricted to the friends and followers domain. This in itself might fetch a very loyal reach for your blog posts but it must not be considered an end to all means. Most WordPress users are complacent with this promotion method considering other means as hectic or costly. They ultimately come to other promotion methods but the precious time wasted could have brought more audience and followers earlier on.</p>
<p>A simple promotion method is to connect WordPress with all your social media accounts and pages. WordPress offers the feature of posting your work simultaneously on all platforms with a single button. This adds a tagline with a link to your post. It’s a simple way to show your users that your WordPress is up and running at all times.</p>
<p>You can step it up by using more interactive tools and software. Instead of just getting a link and tagline you can make posts on all <a href="https://buffer.com/library/social-media-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media platforms</a> individually with an elaborate display of the content as well. This can be done by basic imaging or post-editing software. A more elaborate way is to seek the requirements of particular social media platforms separately and design in accordance with the requirements of each platform. This would provide a certain increase in your audience with the inclusion of users, based on their distinct social media platforms.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=477687" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4223" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/58da17cf.jpg" alt="Essentials of your WordPress Blog Promotion on Social Media - 58da17cf - Zera Creative" width="900" height="90" title="Essentials of your WordPress Blog Promotion on Social Media 13"></a></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>WordPress promotion is essential and this will help you get an audience on the website that you may include in the development plan of your basic idea. It takes a few simple techniques to turn that idea into reality. The use of these tools, with a little effort, shall make you and your blog a successful enterprise.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Small businesses and blogs often struggle in building a great blog audience who loves to read their work and avail their products and services. Larger businesses often market through mainstream media like television, print, billboards, and activations. Smaller businesses and blogs struggle in promoting their actionable content and their services or products to their audience. That is when <a href="https://zeracreative.com/">social media</a> steps in. There are some key ways to promote your business and your blog without having to break the bank!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4739 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-scaled.jpg" alt="12 Ways To Leverage Social Media And Build Blog Audience! - infographic 11 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1920" height="1301" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-scaled.jpg 1594w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-300x203.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-1024x694.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-768x520.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-1536x1041.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-2048x1388.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-960x651.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-600x407.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-944x640.jpg 944w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-11-800x542.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" title="12 Ways To Leverage Social Media And Build Blog Audience! 15"></p>
<h2>Start Your Promotion From Home</h2>
<p>More often than not, blogs and businesses come up with great services, solutions, products, and content. But it keeps sitting on the shelves or websites waiting for someone to show up. Promotion of the brand, however, starts from home. Bring out your social media profiles, and actively promote your services and posts with your friends and family. If they are part of the audience profile you came up with, then these are the first step towards building a blog audience. Even though sometimes, they may not share the same view of how great your brand is, or could be, building numbers on your blog, product or service, can help build a better word of mouth.</p>
<h2>Work On Your Personal Profile</h2>
<p>Build and perfect your own personal profile first. Share your business profile URLs within your own profile, populate your about us section with key details of your business, and mention the kind of products and services you offer. Your personal profile should be a visual landscape of your business so that people can relate you to your business easily. Even if you do not portray yourself as a brand or a person behind your brand, you can still mark the products and services on your personal profile, to denote your support for them. Promote key elements of your business and your blog on your personal profile to indicate your support as well.</p>
<h2>Start Building A Network</h2>
<p>Building a network online and offline can be key in generating leads, building a blog audience, and promoting your brand to your target audiences. Networking can help with recall as people start recognizing the brand. This brand recall can become stronger the more you participate online as well as offline in the communities where your target audiences are found. For example, there are several groups on LinkedIn, Facebook and communities across different forums where your target audiences may hang out. Work to build a strong network in these communities, by helping answer queries, talking to people in general, and communicating with the audiences.</p>
<h2>Participate In All The Right Places</h2>
<p>While networking would indicate hanging out where your audiences are, and getting to know them. Participation would often involve you to be in places that your audiences would be. For example, if your audience profile is such that they would be found amongst social media channels such as LinkedIn and Snapchat that most businesses never think about, then, by all means, participate and use these channels.  If you are actively participating in channels that are the right fit with your blog audience, then you can continue to reap benefits as more visitors come on to your website.</p>
<h2>Engage With Your Target Audience</h2>
<p>While engagement and networking on social media platforms will bring you most of your audience, you should also consider engaging with your target blog audience on other platforms and forums. Social Media is one key to the larger scheme of finding and collecting audience. Another key is finding the audience on forums and communities where engagement can be done through answering questions, posting questions, and sharing anecdotes and stories. With this engagement, your net worth is built and your expertise is highlighted. Quora is a general forum where all sort of audience is found. You can conduct a basic Google Search to find communities that resonate with your brand, to find more audiences there.</p>
<h2>Claim Your Name</h2>
<p>While social media can be a great audience builder, a key tip that most entrepreneurs fail to realize is that your name should be standard across all platforms. This includes your domain name, your social media channel names across different mediums, and your profiles. A singular name can help in finding your social media pages/profiles quickly rather than having to hunt through them. This can build familiarity amongst your audience for an easier transition from your social media page or profile to your website.</p>
<h2>Get Yourself Published</h2>
<p>Most small businesses have found their audiences and claim to fame, through getting published in larger publications. If you prefer to have your name out there amongst your key visitors, then aim to get published. Some key publications that take in articles from various bloggers and businesses include Huffington Post, Forbes, Inc.com, BuzzFeed, and more. You should also use mediums such as LinkedIn and Medium to build your and your brand&#8217;s online presence. It helps when a person searches out on the search engine and comes across details that build your online presence and display you as an expert or a knowledge leader in your field.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Forget Local Networking</h2>
<p>While most businesses work on building a seamless <a href="https://zeracreative.com/">social media</a> presence, local networking is often forgotten. A lot of your audience can come directly from word of mouth. Find out local networking groups, volunteering options, churches, and meetups that you can go to. These have people who are generally going to be like-minded. They will be more in tune based on the kind of audience profile you have created. These audiences can be a great boost in terms of word of mouth for your business as well as your blog.</p>
<h2>Get Your Business Cards Out</h2>
<p>Business cards are often the least used item in a small business or blog. But they can bring about a great boost to your blog if used in the right manner. A business card generally should contain social media channel IDs as well for the receiver to relate to your social media presence. Business cards can help you connect with your audience. They are a great help in brand recall when the receiver views the card again. Both physical and digital business cards can help in this case.</p>
<h2>Get Your Audience To Share</h2>
<p>Once your audience is visiting your blog or your website, the next step is to add options that allow your audience to share your goodness with the world. If you use a WordPress website, there are some key plugins that allow you to create toolbars for social media sharing. Similarly, for other websites built on other platforms, you can build social media sharing toolbars that allow your audience to share your posts, products or services on their profiles.</p>
<h2>Add Click to Tweet Options</h2>
<p>A key trick that quite a few blogs have used recently for good measure is the <a href="https://clicktotweet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click to Tweet</a> Option. You can also build this feature in your blog through plugins and codes. A specific phrase or sentence can be converted into a tweet and embedded into your content. The audience can readily share that piece on their Twitter profile by clicking on the Click To Tweet button. This way, your content is shared with the world, without significant effort from the audience itself. You can leverage social media profiles of your readers to get more audience onto your website this way.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Forget Lesser Used Channels</h2>
<p>More often than not, you can find your blog audience on social media channels that you may personally not be using. For example, some audience may be available on Pinterest, Instagram, Snapchat and LinkedIn. Usually, we may use these channels as a user but not as a small business owner or a blogger. However, these are great hubs to find great audience profiles and build your <a href="https://zeracreative.com/">social media</a> presence. For example, Pinterest is a key tool that a lot of people use to search for relevant content. You can leverage this idea by promoting your products, services and blog posts directly to your blog audience, on Pinterest boards for people to find, share and redirect to your <a href="https://zeracreative.com/">website</a>!</p>

The best way to do this is through the web – Digital Marketing is the best and most convenient solution.</p>
<p>Taking a leaf out of their book will help your business prosper by connecting with the customers at a personal level. Here are some helpful tips for all new as well as existing beauty salon owners:</p>
<h2><b>Website</b></h2>
<p>Making a website is the first thing that you should invest in. The layout should portray the theme of your salon as well as be attractive enough to keep the interest of the website visitor. Clear tabs with information about your salon, your theme/motto and the services that are offered (you may or may not include a rate card) are essential. The website can also include a soothing background music and pictures of the staff and happy customers. Contact details and address are obviously a must!</p>
<h2><b>Social Networks</b></h2>
<p>Once your website is up and running, the next digital media sector that you should target are the social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest etc. Take a look at the existing pages of beauty salons across the nation and in your city. A fun and interactive page are what is required to be maintained. For example, regular tweets with latest fashion and beauty related topics can be uploaded to Twitter &amp; Pinterest.</p>
<h2>Use Facebook’s Potential</h2>
<p>Facebook is an excellent forum for promotion and marketing because of its multiple interactive features. Regular updates about client sessions (satisfied customers will be more than happy to pose for a picture) in the salon can be done by your employees. Professionalism needs to be maintained. Uploading pictures or videos of the latest trends in beauty, makeup, hairstyles, fashion and related areas will keep the interest of the page visitors active.</p>
<h2>Interactive Sessions</h2>
<p>Interactive sessions with your stylists can be arranged on any social media site wherein the clients can directly chat with your stylists and clear their doubts. Also, special offers or coupons can be given out especially for your Facebook fans or Twitter followers.</p>
<h2>Online Appointments</h2>
<p>The option of setting up an appointment online should be made available on all these forums.</p>
<p>Following these simple steps will definitely give your salon business a boost and enable you to reach a variety of clientele. With people checking their Facebook and Twitter almost every hour, you are bound to get the exposure that you desire and excel by providing the best customer service.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">The fashion industry is big and booming today with numerous fashion enthusiasts taking to the Internet to spread the word about their business and to attract customers.</p>
<p>If you would like your fashion business to do better than your competitors you have to do things either differently or better than them. Keep in mind that competition is fierce and over the web, you are competing at an international level. This is the reason why you should do everything in your power to excel.</p>
<p>The good news here is that even though the Internet has increased competition, it has given us easier and quicker ways to beat the competition. One such blessing is social media. Fashionistas are all over social media to promote themselves because this powerful tool can indeed spin wonders.</p>
<p>However, social media is beneficial only when you appreciate its potential and use it accordingly. We have for you a few tips that will enable you to optimize your business using social media:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4762 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-23-scaled.jpg" alt="Best Tips to Generate More Customers from Social Media For Fashion Business - infographic 23 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1920" height="1083" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-23-scaled.jpg 1915w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-23-300x169.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-23-1024x577.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-23-768x433.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-23-1536x866.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-23-2048x1155.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-23-960x541.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-23-600x338.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-23-1135x640.jpg 1135w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-23-800x451.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" title="Best Tips to Generate More Customers from Social Media For Fashion Business 20"></p>
<h2>Use Pictures</h2>
<p>In the fashion world, it is all about visuals. That is why you should establish your presence on social media platforms that are specifically for pictures. These include Pinterest and Instagram. Both these portals are all about pictures and are the best for a fashion business. Of course, you may use Facebook and Twitter but even on these portals, it is advised that you speak through pictures and limit text.</p>
<h2>Customize Your Messages</h2>
<p>It is totally unacceptable to upload the same message on all social media portals. This is because your followers on Twitter have a completely different train of thought when compared to your followers on Instagram. On Twitter, you will see people who are more into technology while Facebook is for everyone. Instagram is specifically for those who love sharing images, as is Pinterest. This is why you should segment your messages based on the platform you are using. Generic messages will not appeal to everyone.</p>
<h2>Establish A Connection</h2>
<p>On social media, direct promotion of your fashion business will not help you at all. Social media is a portal to share information and to connect first. Only then should you think of promoting yourself. Also, the promotion should be discreet. Your focus should be on establishing a connection with your audience by narrating stories about lifestyle. You may also get in touch with your customers to share their stories.</p>
<p>Most of them will be happy to do so. When you share these stories you will attract others as well. You also have the option of creating suggestive, beautiful stories of lifestyle that may appeal to your target audience.</p>
<h2>Retarget Your Visitor With Facebook Ads To Increase Conversion Rates</h2>
<p>Most people are not ready to buy immediately upon seeing an ad or visiting your website. With retargeting you’re able to reach the same people that were thinking about buying your product with reminder ads.</p>
<p>You can retarget visitors to your website by creating <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-website-custom-audiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Custom Audiences</a> with Facebook (with just a snippet of code), and target <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-website-custom-audiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lookalike Audiences</a> as well to expand your reach.</p>
<p>If they don’t purchase—let’s say after a week—you can give them a slight discount in the ad to get them to act. Retargeting people who have abandoned their shopping cart is also a fantastic way to generate sales that otherwise would have been lost.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=477687" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4223" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/58da17cf.jpg" alt="Best Tips to Generate More Customers from Social Media For Fashion Business - 58da17cf - Zera Creative" width="900" height="90" title="Best Tips to Generate More Customers from Social Media For Fashion Business 21"></a></p>
<h2>Create Style Guides</h2>
<p>Create style guides to show your visitors how to wear or incorporate your items into their everyday life.</p>
<p>If you own a fashion brand that sells a variety of clothing items, put together a style guide for your website so that visitors and subscribers can get ideas on how to wear your clothing, and even incorporate pieces into their existing wardrobe.</p>
<p>Don’t limit yourself to just one guide. Style guides can be done seasonally (spring, summer, fall, winter), for special occasions (wedding, party, picnic), holidays (Eid, Christmas, New Year’s), and for more topical themes: travel, work, weekend, beach.</p>
<p>Here is the great example of one of our client: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/closetfashionpk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Closet Fashion</a><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1456 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/closet-fashion-instagram.png" alt="Best Tips to Generate More Customers from Social Media For Fashion Business - closet fashion instagram - Zera Creative" width="890" height="522" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/closet-fashion-instagram.png 890w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/closet-fashion-instagram-300x176.png 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/closet-fashion-instagram-768x450.png 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/closet-fashion-instagram-600x352.png 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/closet-fashion-instagram-800x469.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px" title="Best Tips to Generate More Customers from Social Media For Fashion Business 22"></p>
<p>Guides can be listed as a special section on your website and incorporated into your blog or Instagram, where you can provide more in-depth information on each item in the collection. Try telling a story with the style guide to interest your customer.</p>
<h2>Work With Influencers</h2>
<p>Yes, work with influencers in your category to provide you with access to a new audience, gain social proof, and receive unique content.</p>
<p>To get in front of your ideal audience, work with a popular fashion vlogger or blogger that already has a dedicated following of people who would like your brand. Those with large audiences have built a reputation and are well respected by their readers. They can have a huge impact if they choose to mention, review, or even wear your products. <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7222" src="https://uhurunetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fashion-Digital-Marketing-to-increase-sales.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="https://uhurunetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fashion-Digital-Marketing-to-increase-sales.jpg 300w, https://uhurunetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fashion-Digital-Marketing-to-increase-sales-150x150.jpg 150w, https://uhurunetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fashion-Digital-Marketing-to-increase-sales-299x300.jpg 299w" alt="Fashion Digital Marketing to Increase Sales" width="300" height="301" title="Best Tips to Generate More Customers from Social Media For Fashion Business 23"></p>
<p>You can work with them to create content around a specific campaign or just create gorgeous images with your product. Their influence and creative take on your product will garner great interaction and sales.</p>
<p>Working with bloggers gives you two huge things: you get in front of a new audience and, if you selected the correct influencer, then you’ll gain new customers and the blogger will create content for you. Depending on the collaboration, they will share custom content on their blog, and social channels, and you (the brand) may also get the opportunity to use the content they produce.</p>
<p>When collaborating with a blogger, you can also run Facebook ads featuring the photos of the bloggers to send traffic their way, and in turn, get your product(s) noticed. (Make sure you get a signed agreement before posting images of them and/or their logo.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PRO TIP</strong>: When working with bloggers, provide a brand guide so you give them more guidance and they create the content you’re looking for.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Do Not Try Too Hard</h2>
<p>The more you push, the harder you will fall. This is the mantra on social media. Do not force yourself on social media or push on your customers to buy from you. Keep it interactive and simple, full of colorful images that will attract your target audience. All the content, visual or textual, should be relevant, decent, and interesting.</p>
<blockquote><p>Social media is extremely powerful, especially for the fashion business. Use it to the fullest so that your business sees a boost.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Marketing world as a whole is getting even more fascinating by the advent of Content Marketing. Consequently, the fashion industry has not taken time to catch up and stay way ahead of the curve. It can be used as an ideal example of an industry where content has been projected incredibly smartly to build a brand, expand a social presence and get a hold of the search traffic.</p>
<p>Over 80% companies, blog on a daily basis to get positive ROI for their inbound marketing efforts. Leading fashion brands also have been at the forefront of blogging, posting excellent social content and encouraging widespread sharing of their content. With the vivid visual products that are showcased by stunning personalities automatically half the work is done right there, and the rest is solely in the hands of the content that creates engagement and conversations amongst prospective clients.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4764 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-24-scaled.jpg" alt="How To Grow Your Fashion Business with Content Marketing - infographic 24 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1920" height="1083" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-24-scaled.jpg 1915w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-24-300x169.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-24-1024x577.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-24-768x433.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-24-1536x866.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-24-2048x1155.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-24-960x541.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-24-600x338.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-24-1135x640.jpg 1135w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/infographic-24-800x451.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" title="How To Grow Your Fashion Business with Content Marketing 26"></p>
<h2>Fashions Digital Amalgamation</h2>
<p>In the Fashion world presentation, emotion and uniqueness are the essence of the brand image created. The romance between the Fashion and Digital industries has now reached a level of maturity. Brands today are seen setting new benchmarks in social media success. If you are in the business of marketing luxury fashion brands then the content is the new black.</p>
<p>Reports from <em>eMarketers</em> suggest that the fashion industry has seen unprecedented growth in e-commerce activity in recent years with the use of new marketing technology, called digital marketing, generating huge amounts of sales. So what are the types of content that are seen working for this industry?</p>
<p>Reviews are among the top content types that have driven success for the industry. While many of these are user-generated, companies can also use content writers to create articles discussing the value of certain products. Additionally, content that discusses new trends in fashion will provide prospective clients with more information on some items.</p>
<p>Visual content is also a strong tool for businesses in the fashion industry. Prospects want to see how certain items look when included in different styles and look. Creating interesting content that discusses different styles, and which clothing suits different body types or personalities could provide a strong impetus to convert.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=477687" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4223" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/58da17cf.jpg" alt="How To Grow Your Fashion Business with Content Marketing - 58da17cf - Zera Creative" width="900" height="90" title="How To Grow Your Fashion Business with Content Marketing 27"></a></p>
<h2>The Approach for Independent Fashion Brands</h2>
<p>The single most important part of content marketing is making sure that is it valuable to the customer, and not focused on making the sale. Yet, this tends to be exactly where brands screw up most often and therefore the effectiveness of their efforts is lost.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why it doesn’t work out? Well, we’ll tell you why. What often happens is that the content created on the website of the brand is highly sales-oriented and does not help, educate or generate interest amongst its audience.</p>
<p>To stay away from this you must ask yourself a few basic questions:</p>
<ul class="unorder-class">
<li>What on my website will make the customer want to come back?</li>
<li>Is the information that exists on my website, only product oriented?</li>
<li>Do I offer anything to the customer that goes beyond just making an attempt to a sale?</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, if the answers to these questions are not up to satisfaction, you know it’s time for some change. Because today, with all the options that consumers have it is easier to find a designer or brand that offers something that you do not. Thus, you must create an experience for your customer when they visit your website. You must give them something beyond the product offering.</p>
<p>Content marketing is less pushy than other, more traditional methods. By engaging, educating, and/or helping your customers, you begin to gain their trust in your brand and make them feel as if you have more to offer them than just a product.</p>
<p>Nowadays, customers have started to expect your brand to have a creative content marketing strategy and if you’re not seen implementing them on your website, potential customers will start going elsewhere.</p>
<h2>Guidelines for success</h2>
<ul class="unorder-class">
<li>The first thing to keep in mind when deciding on what kind of content to create is that it must make sense for your brand. Anything that feels forced or unnatural will come across in a negative way and work against rather than for you. In Other words, don’t just create but curate matter.</li>
<li>Differentiate yourself with the content you share. Creating exclusive online products to outshine your competition is not it; you also need to generate content for that extra impact. Viral videos, lookbooks, and catwalk streaming are still strong. Celebrity endorsements are also creating an extra buzz online. Provide white background, and clean product images so that when images of your products are shared on other platforms they still look good and attractive. Consumers love to pin images of their favorite clothes or share them on Facebook with their friends.</li>
<li>Collaborate and encourage sharing of your content. Fashion bloggers now have their own community using social search tools, creating their own trends and heavily influencing a customer’s shopping decisions. Also, don’t limit yourself to just Facebook or Twitter but include Pinterest, Instagram, Polyvore, Google+, Youtube, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="unorder-class">
<li>You must spend some time thinking about your customer. What would he/she like? How does he/she spend their time? What motivates and excites her? Does he/she travel, entertain, cook, craft, or DIY? Create content that speaks to these other aspects of his/her world, beyond his/her clothing and accessory choices, and he/ she will identify your brand as the one with real value.<br />
In the sections to follow we will talk about a few such great examples who speak to the customer about more than just their products.</li>
<li>Lastly, don’t forget to measure your efforts. Things like website traffic, time spent on site, engagement with content (commenting, sharing), and actual sales as a result of this engagement are all important things to note. As you learn what works and what doesn’t and adjust what you’re doing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Few Success stories from the Fashion Industry</h2>
<p>The list below will tell us what some of the brands did and how they stood out from the rest. Also, it will throw light on the content marketing method or trend they shine out with and techniques you can follow for your startup brand or one that is already in the market.</p>
<h3><em>Victoria’s Secret</em></h3>
<p>Yes, it is a big name and yes, we all already know them, then you might be wondering why to talk about them as an example. So, let me tell you, my friends, that you just don’t make it to the top without a struggle. Also, it doesn’t take a minute for a big brand to hit the ground with bad marketing material. The secret all lies in the fact that how you choose to reach and capture your audience.</p>
<p>Much can be learned from Victoria’s Secret’s content and social approach. Their annual Fashion Shows have turned out to be a huge marketing event and generate an enormous quantity of shareable content. Using offline events to generate online content is a smart tactic to engage your audience.</p>
<p>Knowing their clientele in and out, Victoria’s Secret use customer insights to design their Fashion Show and then capture the action in a striking and glossy manner for a much larger audience on social platforms. Of course, it may be difficult to compete with Victoria’s Secret in terms of production budgets, but in your own way, it’s worth investing notable amounts of time and money into the look and feel of your content as it all comes down to visual content when it comes to market fashion products.</p>
<h3><em>Rebecca Minkoff</em></h3>
<p>Rebecca Minkoff’s RMEdit is a great example of a brand that believes in speaking to a customer about more than just her niche products. The innovative team has produced a space that, while always focusing on brand, extends past just bags and shoes, to highlight food, music, travel, arts, and culture, etc. Thus even while talking about other topics, they relate back to fashion and their own products, making it all resonate with their own tone of voice. How Brilliant!</p>
<h3><em>Net-A-Porter</em></h3>
<p>This online fashion brand takes content production to a new level, almost becoming a publisher first and retailer second. Their website and primary shop front appear like a magazine with lots of articles, features, and celebrity interviews. They then utilize their profoundly subscribed social channels to circulate their content and build a vibrant online conversation with their customers. They also showcase videos guiding clients on health issues, beauty secrets, and even yoga, making them relate to the brand even more.</p>
<p>These brands are well established in terms of Content Creators with budgets to match, but in spite of that, it’s apparent that there’s ample that other businesses, both large and small, can learn from them.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So put on your thinking hats, get creative, and dig deeper into how you can exploit content to build your brand today. Regardless of the industry, content marketing is all about connecting with your customers and discovering the basis of a conversation with them. Creating and curating content that makes customers return to you over and over again is challenging but building and getting to know your audience using strategies that work best for your brand and developing your voice is the recipe to success.</p>
