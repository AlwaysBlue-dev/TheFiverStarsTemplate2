<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4284" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/shopify-shipping.png" alt="8 Step Guide to Develop an Ecommerce Store on Shopify - shopify shipping - Zera Creative" width="711" height="458" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/shopify-shipping.png 711w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/shopify-shipping-300x193.png 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/shopify-shipping-600x386.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px" title="8 Step Guide to Develop an Ecommerce Store on Shopify 8"></p>
<h3>Step #7- Activate Your Payment Processor</h3>
<p>On the dashboard, click on the option &#8216;Payments&#8217;. You will discover thousands of payment processors including Stripe and Paypal. Shopify offers its built-in payment processors to developers which are efficient, secure, and advanced. It gives you a complete walk-through of how to integrate and use it. To make your checkout process smooth and transparent, go through the Payment Gateways. Here are the important aspects to create a secure payment gateway.</p>
<p><strong>The transaction fees</strong> &#8211; Go for the payment gateway that charges the lowest amount on every transaction your buyer makes.</p>
<p><strong>Card Types</strong> &#8211; Your gateway should accept a wide variety of bank cards. It ensures eliminating card abandonment.</p>
<p><strong>Offsite Checkout</strong> &#8211; You can even go for offsite payment gateways where the third party takes customers to their platform to make the payments. It&#8217;s a secure solution but a bit complex.</p>
<h3>Step #8 &#8211; Test your Order System</h3>
<p>When creating a Shopify store you can access one of its features &#8216;<a href="https://community.shopify.com/c/Shopify-Discussion/HOW-TO-Test-Mode-Bogus-Purchases/td-p/223942" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bogus Gateway</a>&#8216;. It&#8217;s where users test their orders to make sure everything is perfect and in a flow. What you can do is, carry out the buying process just like a customer from dropping products in the cart to checking out through any of the payment processes. But do cancel the order just in time to get the money refunded. It will give you a clearer overview of how well your store works.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is WordPress Good for Ecommerce? We might have the answer. Soon after the pandemic hits the world, the physical stores in most parts of the world shut down &#8211; due to the contagiousness of the novel COVID-19. With that, citizens across the world have started paying more heed to online selling &amp; buying and it continues to grow strong every passing day.</p>
<p>Sniffing the trend, some smart people have decided to either completely shift their business to online or add online selling into the marketing mix.</p>
<p>To function stores online and sell the items, there’s a need for a platform that hosts the store. Since you’re here reading the content, you’re planning to open an online store and are actively looking for a better option to host your store on. Since WordPress is a well-known content management system and website builder, you want to know whether WordPress is good for eCommerce websites.</p>
<p><strong>WordPress can be potent for an eCommerce website/store or can be totally fatal &#8211; depending upon the business need. For example, for a business with a few products, WordPress is the best option and for stores with a 100s product list — other options could be better. </strong></p>
<p>Is it enough to drive a decision?</p>
<p>Well, there are so many factors combined to formulate a decision, and by the end of the post you would know<br />
When you could use WordPress for <a href="/ecommerce-website-development-services-pakistan/">eCommerce </a>and when to shift to other popular eCommerce platforms like <a href="https://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopify</a> and Magento.</p>
<p>When to host a <a href="https://zeracreative.com/wordpress-development-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website on WordPress</a> and when shouldn’t.</p>
<p>Whether WordPress is secured for ecommerce websites and does it provide better security?</p>
<p>What is that <strong>one Reason</strong> where WordPress becomes a no brainer? Even if all other requirements go against the decision</p>
<p>So, without further ado, let’s dive into considerations,</p>
<h2>Consideration before choosing any host for your store</h2>
<h4>The Size of your store drives your choice</h4>
<p>The size and the products in your eCommerce store are the key factors to drive the decision.</p>
<p>Stores that are big and have a lot of products require prompt handling, which includes clear listings, sleek and intuitive navigations, and much more. Whereas, small stores with fewer products don’t need outrageous handling.</p>
<p>That says if the store is big enough, it would have more problems, especially in regard to maintenance of server and theme. Since WordPress’s WooCommerce is open-source and extremely customizable with third-party plugins and themes, it risks the potential of breaking your store.<br />
How?<br />
The plugins and theme used could have loopholes and errands for malicious coding–any abrupt changes could damage the site completely. Or routinely maintenance could waste a lot of time- which you could invest in doing something productive for your business.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there’re a lot of amazing and huge eCommerce stores based on WordPress’s WooCommerce and are running smoothly. The fact is, these stores used highly paid themes and well-coded glitch-free plugins, backed up by good web hosts. Alongside, it requires maintenance fees.</p>
<p>However, if your store doesn’t require prompt handling, and doesn&#8217;t have a tremendous number of products, you can <a href="https://zeracreative.com/ecommerce-website-development-services-pakistan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build your eCommerce store</a> on WordPress. In fact, it’s one of the best CRMs in terms of user-friendliness, posting, maintaining, and updating. And best for small to mid-sized.</p>
<p>Summing it up, stores that are huge with 100s of products are better hosted on other amazing WooCommerce alternatives (there’s a downside, discussed below). Whereas, WordPress’s WooCommerce is potent for websites that have a few products.</p>
<p>We have discussed the impact of size. And now let’s discuss an amazing Woocomerce alternative.</p>
<h2>Shopify VS WordPress Vs Magento for Ecommerce</h2>
<p>This’s one of the fierce debates. Some savvy marketers believe WordPress’s WooCommerce has more to offer, some believe Magento has amazing features for eCommerce, and some marketers vouch for Shopify, and believe Shopify has an edge over others.</p>
<p>In reality, all claims can be correct depending on your needs. Let’s compare together to elicit which one is better for your needs.</p>
<h3>Themes &amp; Plugins</h3>
<p>Shopify offers a classy set of well-designed templates. This means, that all their themes are professionally designed &#8211; even plugins come with no glitches. Whereas, the number of WordPress themes and plugins is second to none in terms of quantity. But can be hazardous to choose among the best. In simple terms, businesses with no or little technical knowledge can start a store on Shopify and pick a theme and plugins from the lot.</p>
<p>Whereas, businesses with budgets could start with WordPress + WooCommerce, providing they have the technical knowledge or have technical staff managing the store.</p>
<p>Last comes Magento, it doesn’t explicitly offer custom themes, so you’ve to rely on third-party tools for premium themes and you’ve to build ground up. So it requires prompt handling and technical knowledge to manage a site. Since it requires rigorous support, it could break your bank.</p>
<p>Based on where you’re in your business, and technical skills you can select what works best for you.</p>
<h3>Website Responsiveness</h3>
<p>All the themes and plugins on Shopify&#8217;s official website are responsive. This means, that all can adjust automatically across any device without looking botched up.</p>
<p>To select the best WordPress themes and plugins, you need to have knowledge–of which ones are responsive. Though, it’s easy to find out. Just do a google search; as you did to read this content. And you will have a lot of options before your eyes.</p>
<p>Same as WordPress, for Magento you require some knowledge about themes that would work for the kind of site you run. But because it&#8217;s a bit complex it could cost you more than the other options.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it’s always better to work with professionals like us who’ve been maintaining stores for years.</p>
<h3>Content Management</h3>
<p>Posting content on <a href="/eCommerce-website-development-services-pakistan/">eCommerce websites</a> is the best way to gain organic traction and sell more products. Providing, both Shopify and WordPress have amazing content management systems. Whereas, Magento doesn’t match the two on these premisses, rightly so; since it was developed by keeping product scalability in mind. However, you can manage content on Magneto.</p>
<p>In comparison, WordPress’s content management supersedes any other content management system by a country mile. As <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress captures</a> <strong>61.8% </strong>market share.</p>
<p>WordPress has content versioning—every single version of a pis age separately reserved/hold within a post or on a page and can replace/use or insert. Unfortunately, Shopify doesn’t have that luxury.</p>
<p>Next, WordPress allows setting different categories and tags flexibly when comparing with other options. That presents in a visually appealing and easily navigating way so anywho one lands on a website can easily navigate through.</p>
<p>For posting content—WordPress is the spearhead. But if we talk especially about product placing and management, both Shopify and Magento are intuitive and straightforward. The reason beithat ng, both are eCommerce dedicated SaaS solutions.</p>
<p>Plus, the option of <em>‘<strong>automated collections</strong>’</em> (Automated collections means you can use product titles, tags, price, etc. to create collections.) in both stores tie the competition among the two for an ultimate choice for companies with 100s of products.</p>
<h3>SEO for WordPress Vs Shopify</h3>
<p>For eCommerce business, SEO plays a huge part—essential to getting discovered organically. No business can always rely on Google Adwords or Facebook ads to generate traffic. At some point, every business wants organic traffic that sells its product.</p>
<p>Most WordPress themes and plugins are SEO-friendly and provide better optimization opportunities. However, to nail the SEO of your eCommerce stores hosted on WordPress, you need some key understanding of Meta descriptions, alt text, Product URL, page load speed, and much more.</p>
<p>Next, if you lack knowledge of SEO, then Shopify is a better option since most of the SEO functions are automated. But there’s a downside to it, you can’t create simple URL structures on Shopify.</p>
<p>Last, Magento offers optimization options for Google like it’s responsive (operating equally well across devices), user-friendly, and also feature-intensive (add as many features), but has issues with loading speed… And page speed contributes a lot to SEO.</p>
<h3>Blogging for Ecommerce</h3>
<p>We would want to discuss blogging separately from the above content management subhead because blogging is a marketing strategy to attract a lot of customers.</p>
<p>Blogging is by far one of the most tremendous ways to <a href="https://zeracreative.com/seo-company-pakistan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generate immense traffic on the website</a> and sell more products organically.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>When you create content besieging the product you sell &#8211; your customers see you as an authority and chances of organic selling increase. Because they’d believe that these guys have knowledge and authority over the subject &#8211; they’d consider buying.</p>
<p>Through blogging, we create funnels to sell products, and funnelling requires different strategies for unique products. So it’s a high-end strategy to convert prospects that land.</p>
<p>In light of the study, blogging prominence is unequivocal if you want to sell products on auto for your eCommerce business. And for this purpose, WordPress is the spearhead. It has some amazing features and supports content publishing and SEO.</p>
<p>Whereas, Shopify and Magento are super focused on product placement and automation. It’s safer to say that if selling through a blog is in your marketing mix, then WordPress can be the best option.</p>
<p>No, it didn’t say that Shopify and Magento do not support blogs and content. In fact, Magento is quite user-friendly and requires no technical knowledge to add posts. But WordPress has no substitute in this category, and it’s because WordPress is widely acknowledged as a CMS that supports blogging.</p>
<h3>Functionality Matters for Ecommerce Website</h3>
<p>Better functionality is the most preferable choice for <a href="https://www.designrush.com/agency/ecommerce/trends/ecommerce-solutions-small-businesses" target="_blank" title="eCommerce for small businesses" rel="noopener">eCommerce for small businesses</a>. WordPress, Magento, and Shopify provide better functionality. However, Shopify triumphs over WordPress in some ways. The reason is, that Shopify is an all-in solution for eCommerce stores, so it’s intuitive and easy to set up and offers everything you would need to kick-start the store and take it to the target audience.</p>
<p>About Magento, it beats both of them. Magento was developed with scalability in mind. You can have over 1000 products listed on Magento without much trouble – provided you have the correct technical support.</p>
<p>So for the functionality of huge stores – no comparison to Magento. Hands down. Next, Shopify can also be great for functionality, and you can operate it without much technical know-how. Whereas, WordPress does offer great functionality by using third-party integration tools such as WooCommerce.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, with additional lightweight plugins, you can make your store more functional.</p>
<p>The point is if you can afford to work with developers and want better, customized functionality of your store, then WordPress could be the choice. But if you don&#8217;t have a budget and are just starting out &#8211; Shopify is the answer.</p>
<h3>Security for E-commerce</h3>
<p>If your website is not secure, your business is at risk.</p>
<p>Providing that Shopify has better in-built security. It’s Shopify’s responsibility to provide you with a secure website. Once your business is set up, you’d not need to worry about cyber-attacks as Shopify has it covered for you.</p>
<p>Whereas, WordPress’s security is in your hands. It could be a negative point or a positive one. Since it’s in your hands, you can make it more secure and sturdy. But for that, you need to have knowledge about the best, glitch-free, and non-malicious code themes and plugins.</p>
<p>Besides, you’d need to keep checking on regular updates to avoid web crashing and give a smooth experience.<br />
Last, Magento is no different from WordPress. Since it&#8217;s open-source and one has to mostly rely on third-party tools. So the concern with Magento is the same as WordPress.</p>
<p>The point is, Shopify is secured to some extent; no doubt. But for WordPress and Magento you’d need to be proactive. Proactive means to keep a check on everything and anything to avoid security concerns. Alongside, you need to bout your store’s security by working with professionals like us who know how to ensure the security of a WordPress store.</p>
<p>Caveat: If you go with Shopify, you need to make sure you’d purchase templates directly from Shopify. Else, you could risk compromising website security.</p>
<h3>Does WordPress offer better integration for eCom stores?</h3>
<h3>Security for E-commerce</h3>
<p>Integration of a store with other 3rd party service providers is important to make the website function better. So it would give customers a better experience and give you (as a store owner) an advantage to customize it to your needs.</p>
<p>Shopify allows you to integrate a lot of cool tools that would make it easy to build a complete ecosystem – that handles everything from product placement to checkouts. Though Shopify is always the second guess integrating with other solutions and only allow integration when satisfied since they’re managing your website security all by themselves. This results in fewer integration options with 3rd party tools when compared with WordPress.</p>
<p>Whereas, Magento offers an enormous range of features that you could integrate with your store. 1000s of plugins and integration options are available. But, could get complicated for non-technical individuals and small store owners with moderate budgets.</p>
<p>Last, WordPress has a ton of integration options. More than enough for any business requirements. Since it doesn’t screen security, you’d need some knowledge about secure options. And with more options, you can further embellish your website</p>
<p>Better work with professionals who have knowledge about everything you need for a <a href="https://zeracreative.com/website-development-company-in-karachi-pakistan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sleek website</a>.</p>

<h2>If Aesthetics is your main concern, go with WordPress all the way</h2>
<p>Have you ever purchased a product from a website that looks dull, mundane, and pale?</p>
<p>For an eCommerce store, aesthetics have remarkable weightage – without a doubt. It is right, as <a href="https://www.inc.com/logan-chierotti/harvard-professor-says-95-of-purchasing-decisions-are-subconscious.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customers buy on emotions</a> and later satisfy logic.</p>
<p>First, you have to win their heart, then prove to them the logic behind it. This’s the psychology of buying that comes in handy when making purchasing decisions.</p>
<p>This’s where WordPress chimes in and outshine. With the plethora of plugins and themes WordPress offers, you can create anything—anything means ANYTHING.</p>
<p>From the web layout to the colour combination, to the button placements, to the typography and literally everything. It gets fully customized and allows your product to stand out.</p>
<p>There’re a number of aspects that come in handy while selecting a platform to host a store. However, to sell the products and provide a seamlessly beautiful visual experience to your customers—you need WordPress + WooCommerce.<br />
There’s no better choice than this.</p>
<p>It doesn’t mean to negate Shopify or any other alternative options. All the other options offer some incredible themes and plugins and integration options. But none could get closer to WordPress due to high customization.</p>
<p>The point is, if you truly want to sell products, you need a visually appealing website that resonates with customers on so many levels. Then WordPress is the answer.</p>
<p>However, if you think aesthetics have nothing much to do with selling then you have a lot to choose from.</p>
<h2>Summing it up</h2>
<p>After a thorough study on the topic, it’s obvious that both WordPress and Shopify have benefits and drawbacks.<br />
Both are excellent choices &#8211; providing the need.</p>
<p>If you’re an up-and-coming eCommerce store owner and short on budget—you could go with Shopify. Or if you have 100s of products to lean with, Shopify is also a better choice, since it offers better automation and intuitive product placement experience.</p>
<p>And if you have a massive budget and have over 100s, or 1000s of products in your store, then you can consider Magento. The reason is, that you can get better customization over Shopify.</p>
<p>Whereas, if you have a moderate budget, not a huge list of products, and want to go all-in with marketing, aesthetics, and customization, WordPress is the ultimate choice. Not something you could consider, but a full and final option.</p>
<p>Before you leave the place, know that security is a huge concern and could sabotage your business in a matter of minutes if not catered to beforehand. So if you plan to go with WordPress, be sure you work with professionals, like us, who can handle website security, third-party tool integration, and website responsiveness.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The bottom line is, that WordPress is an ultimate choice due to its customization and Marketing benefits. Providing the technical side of things is handled by professionals like us. </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To stay relevant in today’s competitive market, most small to mid-sized businesses are on the lookout for a professional website. Because a professional WordPress website adds to the credibility of a business, which helps gain more customers and generate more gross profits.</p>
<p>But the issue arises when they’ve to decide which website builder can give a professional-looking website. Since WordPress is a famous website builder, its name tops the mind. You’re here means you also need to know, whether WordPress is good for professional websites.</p>
<p>Based on the arguments, authoritative claims, and statistics from credible resources, it’s safer to claim that websites built on WordPress are highly professional which help establishes credibility and if optimized well would attract relevant customers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Is it all to decide?</p></blockquote>
<p>Absolutely Not! There’s so much more to know before you could decide.</p>
<p>Throughout the post, you’ll see the reason why <a href="https://zeracreative.com/wordpress-development-company/">WordPress can give you a professional-looking website</a>. Besides, you’ll see what problems you could encounter with your WordPress website and what to do about it &#8211; which is indispensable to know if you want to run your business website smoothly.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s get into the nuts and bolts of analyzing the query in detail.</p>
<h3>7 Characteristics of a Professional Website;</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4751 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-16-scaled.jpg" alt="Is WordPress Good for Professional Websites? (Detailed Analysis) - infographic 16 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1920" height="1032" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-16-scaled.jpg 1920w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-16-300x161.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-16-1024x550.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-16-768x413.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-16-1536x825.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-16-2048x1100.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-16-960x516.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-16-600x322.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-16-1191x640.jpg 1191w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/infographic-16-800x430.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" title="Is WordPress Good for Professional Websites? (Detailed Analysis) 10"></p>
<h2>1. Well Designed and Functional</h2>
<p>Website aesthetics and design play a huge role to give off a professional look. It doesn’t need to go overboard and create something out of the ordinary. But the design theme, choice of colour, and meaningful graphics should be effective for the target market.</p>
<p>All these aspects are necessary to grab attention, portray a coherent message, and give a pleasant experience. Also, it adds to the vitality of conversions. Since every single graphical aspect is important for better conversions.</p>
<p>Next, a website must have a purpose that binds the overall design together, and that’s functionality. Suppose one opts in by giving their email address. Upon opting, they’re being directed to XYZ place. That XYZ place, or the following location, you direct them to should be thoroughly planned out. In other words, where do they appear next after their initial action?</p>
<p>Everything in the process must be sleek and bound with a purpose-designed functionality.</p>
<p>Does WordPress have?</p>
<p>You better believe it &#8211; WordPress offers over 3500 GPL-licensed themes. These themes are designed differently by keeping different business needs and purposes in mind. Further, WordPress is an open-source website where you can customize your website to your needs. (Caveat: That involves a bit of technical knowledge)</p>
<p>Done with design and functionality. Let’s move on to navigation.</p>
<h2>2. Smooth Navigation</h2>
<p>Smooth navigation adds to the appearance aspect that gives users a convenient experience. Advisably, the limited number of items with proper navigations in menus is better for user experience.</p>
<p>From the home page to the last page, all the breadcrumbs navigations need to be as intuitive as possible. Suppose your customer lands on the product page; it must have clear navigation to the home page and vice versa. An easy-to-use interface with intuitive navigation almost always spells out everything, which is a smart approach to increasing conversion rate.</p>
<p>With WordPress themes, simplified navigation is possible. Themes have their own preset navigations. Plus, some plugins would further help with customized navigations.</p>
<p>However, if your website is big and has a lot going on, you better require technical knowledge to further customize it.</p>
<p>Great, you have impeccable and sleek navigations, but what if your customers never get to see your website?</p>
<h2>3. Website Page Speed (Load time)</h2>
<p>A good professional website loads fast. No matter how amazing aesthetics your website has if it doesn&#8217;t load your customers would bounce off before ever experiencing it.</p>
<p>Scary, isn’t it?</p>
<p><a href="https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/how-speed-affects-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research by Hosting tribunal</a> shows the importance of 1s delay in website loading.</p>
<p>1-second delay accounts for 11% reduce page views. 16% customer satisfaction plummets by 1s site load delay. 1s delay swipes away 17% of the coveted conversion rate.</p>
<p>Have you ever thought of that? Interesting! In the bigger scheme of things, these numbers are large. 17% conversion rate just by increasing the site load speed by 1s. Crazy! Flip the script, 17% less in profits if it takes 1 extra second. Lots more to think about.</p>
<p>For every professional website we ever worked on, we make sure it loads fast. This not only adds to the professionalism but also affects overall website performance on search engines.</p>
<p>With WordPress, you can reduce site speed by using a fast-loading theme, using fewer plugins, shortening picture size that better optimize, emptying trash, reducing post revisions, drafts, and trackbacks, Enable Gzip compression, Minify and combining CSS and JavaScript, Enabling Browser caching, and install a cache plugin.</p>
<p>Here, you need to be vigilant, any rogue plug-in would reduce your website speed. Nonetheless, a perfect blend is what everyone should aim for.</p>
<p>Conceivably, you’ve checked in all those boxes still your website would remain slow.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because of your web hosting. Choosing the right hosting plan impacts a lot on site speed. This’s an important element for a professional website.</p>
<h2>4. It should be SEO Optimized</h2>
<p>If your website doesn’t show up in search results, would it make sense of anything we discuss above?</p>
<p>In today’s fast-paced internet world, it’s oddly important to optimize websites for better SERPs rankings. That requires constant testing, on-page, and Off-Page SEO optimization, Keywords Optimization, better HTML and CSS coding, Minifying JavaScripts and CSS codes, proper navigations, and much more</p>
<p>There goes a lot of technical programming knowledge to better optimize websites for search engines.</p>
<p>Every professional website is SEO optimized. The reason is, that the better the optimized website, the more relevant customers land on your website.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s suppose you want to rank for “Vegan Diet” as you are selling a vegan diet book through the blog. You craft world-class content, do all the SEO, and secure the topmost Google position. By staying on top, you’d have 750 prospects landing on your website every single month. Doesn’t it make your profit register ring?</p>
<p>With WordPress, SEO customization is easy, concerning that you know the technical side of things, and how to minify CSS and JavaScript coding, photo optimization, and a few other aspects.</p>
<p>All in all, WordPress is easily optimized. That&#8217;s why <strong>WordPress websites dominate Google SERPs by a long shot</strong>.</p>
<p>Ok! Got it. Your website is SEO optimized for the web but does it also optimize for mobile</p>
<h2>5. Mobile Optimized</h2>
<p>The searches on mobile have surged, and now every other query is being searched on a mobile or desktop. This means around <strong>50%</strong> of consumers are using mobile to search for queries.</p>
<p>That implicitly claims that if your website is not responsive and isn&#8217;t fully optimized for both laptop and mobile/tablet, chances for high profits margin would diminish, which results in an upset consumer base. Google&#8217;s study reveals 48% of mobile consumers who visit a non-friendly mobile website, would think that the company is not serious about the business.</p>
<p>That largely adds to the professionalism of a website.</p>
<p>Regarding WordPress. Yes! WordPress <a href="https://zeracreative.com/case-mobile-friendly-responsive-websites-todays-consumer/">websites can be responsive </a>and mostly are responsive. Depending upon the theme choice and plugins. Plus, some customized settings.</p>
<h2>6. Are Professional Websites Secure?</h2>
<p>In today’s internet world, security is a massive concern. Not just for giant multinational companies, but for companies of all sizes.</p>
<p>Hackers and cyber thieves are always rooting to access sensitive data and crucial information. On average, every 39 seconds, a cyber-attack took place that steals data from unsecured or mildly secured sites.</p>
<p>That’s why big-sized companies pay huge bucks to keep the hackers off.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, every professional website needs to have good web security.</p>
<p>With that, WordPress is secure as long as the developers follow the best practices… Some plugins and themes are secure; however, not all themes and plugins are secure. That could call for certain security attacks.</p>
<p>Better work with professionals like us who know how to keep your WordPress website secure. Web security is quite technical; it isn’t like you can’t make it secure &#8211; NO! You can &#8211; but it’s highly likely that a few glitches would allow spammers and stealthier to sneak through.</p>
<p>TIP: Keep your website up-to-date that way you minimize the risk of cyber-attack. <a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2019/03/hacked-website-trend-report-2018.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“As 44% hacking caused by outdated WordPress sites”</a></p>
<p>That segue to the importance of relevant content on a website…</p>
<h2>7. Relevant Content</h2>
<p>Crafting relevant content on the topic you’d want to be known for is incredibly important on any website. Especially, if it intends to sell either services or products.</p>
<p>By creating content, you win positions on Google SERPs that land traffic to your blog/website. The more relevant traffic your website gets, the better your conversion rates are. This works hand in hand with SEO. And to create and publish professional-looking content you need a Content Management System.</p>
<p>WordPress is the world-class Content Management System (CMS). <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress accounts for <strong>61.8%</strong> of the market share</a>, Followed by Joomla, which sits at <strong>4.7%</strong>. No comparison… Indeed! A clear winner.</p>
<p>Anyone with little or no knowledge can post professional-looking content on <a href="https://zeracreative.com/wordpress-development-company/">professional-looking WordPress Website</a> and can enjoy a traffic surge.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Key Statistics helping to decide whether to make a professional website on WordPress</h2>
<p>Opinions vary and can take biases. Whereas, data and statistics never lie on the face. They’re the representation of the truth, debunk myths, and put cessation on biases.</p>
<p>Let’s peek inside what story data unfolds.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://wordpress.com/about/?aff=2718" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“WORDPRESS IS POWERING 35% OF THE WEB” </a></strong></p>
<p>WordPress has been around since 2003. It was not preferable back then, but now it has come a long way, and unsurprisingly, powering 35% of the web. That shows the dominance of WordPress across the markets. From small businesses to Fortune 500s, its acknowledgement is everywhere.</p>
<p>That’s one reason why you need to have a <a href="https://zeracreative.com/wordpress-development-company/">Professional WordPress website</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://digital.com/wordpress-hosting/wordpress-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“WordPress Dominates Google SERPs with 2.28 BILLION RESULTS” </a></strong></p>
<p>Astonishing is the word for such statistics. When you hop on Google search and write WordPress you’d be surprised to see that many searches related to WordPress. Even the word *Hate* has fewer searchers than WordPress. LOL.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://w3techs.com/blog/entry/wordpress-powers-25-percent-of-all-websites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“WordPress is behind 30.3% of the top 1000 websites” </a></strong></p>
<p>Do you need to go any further after reading this? 300 out of 100 websites are on WordPress. This validates the point that WordPress is fantastic for Professional websites.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/seo-for-bloggers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“WordPress takes care of 80-90% Of Google’s Crawling issues” </a></strong></p>
<p>According to Matt Cuts, “Sites built with WordPress can rank search results because the CMS takes care of 80-90% Google’s crawling issues,”. Doesn’t that vindicate <a href="https://zeracreative.com/seo-important-key-ways-build-great-seo/">WordPress SEO friendliness</a>?</p>
<hr />
<p>Hold on before you go with WordPress for your professional website, let’s look at statistics against WordPress.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sucuri got the highest% of cleanup requests from WordPress. (90% of all websites cleaned by them in 2018)</p></blockquote>
<p>That doesn’t mean WordPress is insecure. Since its open-source, anyone can build themes and plugins which come with security vulnerabilities. Here, requires proper knowledge of this subject.</p>
<h3>Some Top Professional WordPress Websites</h3>

<p>We can go on and on and on to add more credible names that are using WordPress. We believe these 30+ names are enough to give you a positive perspective on WordPress.</p>
<p>Our question is, are you still on the fence?</p>
<p>But, before you leave the place let’s discuss some Pros and Cons – (Based on Primary research, and years of experience)</p>
<h2>WordPress Pros</h2>
<ol>
<li>WordPress is FREE</li>
<li>Extremely customizable &#8211; From designs, features, to functionalities. Everything can be customized based on preference. It&#8217;s open-source which means you can make your own plugins, own themes, or can use third-party free or paid themes, plugins, shopping tools, and much more to make the website look better.</li>
<li>The possibilities are endless. Undoubtedly.</li>
<li>Excellent repository of world-class plugins. Other CMS solutions have not more than a few options for distinct features. But in WordPress, the choices are almost endless. Which is brilliant for a professional website.</li>
<li>WordPress is the world’s best Content Management System.</li>
<li>Great for SEO. <a href="https://zeracreative.com/best-seo-company-in-karachi/">Doing WordPress SEO</a> is easy as it’s open-source so anyone with little technical HTML and CSS knowledge can make it SEO friendly.</li>
<li>Budget Friendly &#8211; You don’t need to spend tons to create a professional-looking WordPress website.</li>
</ol>
<h2>WordPress Cons</h2>
<ol>
<li>The updates are not automatic and can break sites. Be vigilant with what theme or plugin you use. Free Plugins and Themes are more prone to crashes.</li>
<li>Since it’s the largest CMS, spammers love to spam. Unfortunately, you’ve to keep your site healthy from spammers all by yourself. Nothing automatic here, Cringy.</li>
<li>Another downside of it being a most-used CRM, a lot of hackers are always on the lookout to sneak inside and steal your data or damage your website. So, always update the software when they’re due, and keep patching plugins to the latest versions.</li>
<li>If you’re not well versed with plugins and themes better not to implement it yourself. Because it can hugely impact your page load speed. So, it’s a great concern.</li>
<li>Securing a WordPress website can be hazardous if your Programming knowledge is not good.</li>
<li>To fully customize the design to your needs, you need programming knowledge. Sometimes, you want to customize navigations, border sizing, change Typography, and many other things. Without HTML/CSS/PHP/jQuery knowledge, it would cause issues.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>In the discussion above, we’ve touched upon several factors that make up whether WordPress is a viable option for professional websites.</p>
<p>Plus, we also touched upon some factors that vouch against WordPress for a professional website.</p>
<p>Also, we saw a few hugely popular brand websites developed on WordPress.</p>
<p>All of the above dissection concludes on the point that WordPress has been the most successful, widely used, and acknowledged platform across all industries. As it’s highly customizable.</p>
<p>Like any other web development platform, it has a few glitches and areas that need improvement.</p>
<p>But the best point is all such mistakes are avoidable and manageable with better programming know-how.</p>
<p>The final verdict is</p>
<blockquote><p>WordPress is amazing for Professional Websites</p></blockquote>
<p>And with advanced knowledge, it runs smooth – without any trouble.</p>
