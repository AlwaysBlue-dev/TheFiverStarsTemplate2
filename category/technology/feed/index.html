										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AI wonders are making graphic design agencies giddy with excitement and terrifying them at the same time. Its massive transformation into the tech world has shaken numerous industries and the design world is no exception.</p>
<p>Where newbies fear AI to be a substitute, professionals know how to leverage its full capacities. So, if you are wondering how the technology can help transform the design industry and what ways AI can assist an ethical designer, here&#8217;s the blog to find your answers.</p>
<h2>Growth and Application of AI Across Major Industries</h2>
<p>AI has experienced a snowballing adoption rate over the years due to its uncompromising efficiency and advances. According to the <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/3104/artificial-intelligence-ai-worldwide/#dossierKeyfigures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statista report</a>, the global market size reached $327.5 billion in 2021.</p>
<p>Whereas, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-11-22-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-artificial-intelligence-software-market-to-reach-62-billion-in-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner</a> predicted AI software to reach $62 billion in 2022 alone. The global annual revenue of AI software currently is around $50 billion, see below:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4349" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies.png" alt="Future of AI Designs: Guide For Graphic Design Agencies - future of ai designs guide for graphic design agencies - Zera Creative" width="532" height="391" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies.png 532w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies-300x220.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px" title="Future of AI Designs: Guide For Graphic Design Agencies 4"></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.tractica.com/research/artificial-intelligence-market-forecasts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Omdia</a></p>
<p>AI software integrates a business with its uncountable benefits. Reduced operational time, greater business insights, automation, enhanced productivity and reduced human error are some it powers up any business.</p>
<p>At present, tech giants such as Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft are spending billions of dollars on AI products and services. However, considering the potential of Artificial Intelligence, universities are making it a prominent part of their curricula. All the major industries have now untapped the undeniable significance and the role of AI to influence innovation and advancements in terms of productivity, security and efficiency. So, how does AI transform the design industry? Let&#8217;s dive deep below:</p>
<h2>Future of AI Designs: Rising Above the Hype</h2>
<p>To let AI assist graphic design agencies with its full capacity and potential there is a need to first deconstruct it. Instead of thinking about AI as <strong>“artificial intelligence”</strong>– a substitute, consider it as <strong>“augmented intelligence”</strong>. Designers need to conceptualise AI as a tool that augments the level of intelligence in a service in terms of its overall quality or productivity.</p>
<p>AI bots are not replacing designers but instead assisting them in terms of optimization and speed. A designer using AI software tends to create designs faster and with greater proficiency. AI bots have the power to analyze vast amounts of data and offer accurate suggestions to enable a designer to create a most engaging and industry-specific design.</p>
<h3>Speedy Design Prototyping</h3>
<p>With the help of AI tools, designers can create multiple prototype versions that can be A/B tested with users. The tools assist in scanning basic sketches for speedy design prototyping. In the AI tool users enter a few parameters and get a library full of UI components that provide a prototype which is aligned with the company&#8217;s design system. Airbnb is one of those early adopters who are using this technology to generate design components using computer vision-enabled AI and machine learning.</p>
<h3>Seamless Product Localization</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4350" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies-zera-creative.png" alt="Future of AI Designs: Guide For Graphic Design Agencies - future of ai designs guide for graphic design agencies zera creative - Zera Creative" width="670" height="234" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies-zera-creative.png 670w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies-zera-creative-300x105.png 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies-zera-creative-600x210.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" title="Future of AI Designs: Guide For Graphic Design Agencies 5"></p>
<p>AI has introduced game-changing models to integrate personalization in the design industry. Google, Facebook and Netflix have been using AI technology to capture the attention of their users and keep them engrossed in their platforms. Two major problems that every designer has encountered were product localisation and the translation of a design into multiple languages, both of these issues are now fully catered to by AI.</p>
<p>Google’s neural machine translation embedded AI bots allows users instantly translate visual information into another language. Moreover, Netflix is leveraging AI to localization of show banners into different languages along with artwork personalization. With AI bots the localized and personalized graphics are instantly created without there need for designers to spend time on them. All that is needed is a skim through to approve or reject the design if necessary.</p>
<h3>Unique Packaging Designs</h3>
<p>A human mind may seize to restrict its capabilities under a certain condition or situation. For instance, for a designer to create multiple unique copies for the same brand having the same ideology is a bit complicated. However, with the help of AI, a professional can commit millions of unique designs with each having incredibly engaging creativity.</p>
<p>The AI algorithms untapped dozens of distinctive patterns, colours and aesthetics creating seven million unique <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2017/06/01/algorithm-seven-million-different-jars-nutella-packaging-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">packaging designs for Nutella</a>. It accelerated the product sales that were presented with captivating designs printed on the front of each jar in Italy. The technology usurped the traditional role of a graphic designer to spend hours creating unique designs.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4351" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/nutella-ai-packaging.png" alt="Future of AI Designs: Guide For Graphic Design Agencies - nutella ai packaging - Zera Creative" width="412" height="392" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/nutella-ai-packaging.png 412w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/nutella-ai-packaging-300x285.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px" title="Future of AI Designs: Guide For Graphic Design Agencies 6"></p>
<h2>The Need For Graphic Designers To Co-Create With AI</h2>
<p>AI design software enables designers to produce eye-catching designs faster and quicker. The bots refine a product&#8217;s image by successfully comparing it with millions of others. it helps in generating enhanced user engagements.</p>
<p>Moreover, by incorporating a personalized touch into the designs brands can generate an accelerated ROI. AI targets multiple data points to fully comprehend a user&#8217;s journey and enables designers the rich data to create the most targetted designs.</p>
<p>AI using facial recognition is able to determine age, gender, context, location and the current mood of users. With this data, a UX designer can target the audience more efficiently.<br />
According to the research, the use of digital assistance by 2021 would reach 1.8B. Hence, with the use of coupling AI and voice recognition, UX designers are able to create speedier and more efficient designs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, AI enables designers to leverage usability metrics. It processes a large amount of data that results in the creation of high-performing designs for products. Lastly, by co-creating with AI, designers can ponder on how users read and look at data that can help them in paying more attention to important areas to target.</p>
<h3>Key Giveaways</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have to agree with the claim of many web developers and digital marketers that websites have come a long way from web pages that only contained textual information and photos to today’s ones that have much more complex content. Customer expectations are much higher than before, so now the website should inform, entertain, but also offer an intuitive general experience of staying on it, which in simple language means to be easy to navigate.</p>
<p>Everything, from the aesthetics of the site, to the place where the call-to-action will be placed, affects how long the customer will stay on it. <a href="https://zeracreative.com/wordpress-development-company/">How to make a website more user-friendly</a> than it used to be is a topic we are constantly contemplating and below we share with you the conclusions we have reached.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4722 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/infographic-05-scaled.jpg" alt="8 Ways to Make Your Website More User-Friendly - infographic 05 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1920" height="1287" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/infographic-05-scaled.jpg 1611w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/infographic-05-300x201.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/infographic-05-1024x687.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/infographic-05-768x515.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/infographic-05-1536x1030.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/infographic-05-2048x1373.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/infographic-05-960x644.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/infographic-05-600x402.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/infographic-05-954x640.jpg 954w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/infographic-05-800x536.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" title="8 Ways to Make Your Website More User-Friendly 8"></p>
<h2>1. Listen to the Needs of the Users</h2>
<p>Always ask regular visitors/customers of your website on behalf of the brand what they think should be found on the site and how it can be improved. When you receive this type of information, directly from those who are your primary target group, you come to important knowledge and see the content on the site through the eyes of customers, for whom it is intended.</p>
<p>Sometimes these comments are very precise, so with their help, you can better arrange the content and elements on the site. When the user is placed in the center of the process and the design and content of the site are made according to him, he automatically becomes user-friendly.</p>
<h2>2. Increase the Loading Speed</h2>
<p>The expectations of the average customer when he enters a website are such that he wants the content of the site to be loaded as soon as possible, so to speak, at the speed of light. They have these expectations especially when it comes to mobile devices. This means that (when ‘translated’ into statistics) half of them <a href="https://www.theindustry.fashion/gone-in-3-seconds-mobile-shoppers-dont-wait-for-websites-to-load/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expect the site to load in two to three seconds</a> and if that does not happen, they leave it.</p>
<h2>3. Share Accurate and Relevant Information</h2>
<p>In order for customers to make a well-thought-out purchase decision, they need to be familiar with a somewhat broader context and more information than the basic information they come across on, say, social media. If they have to ‘dig’ to learn such information on the site, they will certainly think that the company is hiding something and that the brand is not transparent enough.</p>
<p>Therefore, especially when it comes to the sale of some more complex machines or devices, it is important to explain the benefits of use as simply as possible, but also clearly and comprehensively enough, and so on.</p>
<h2>4. Make Navigation Intuitive</h2>
<p>When a customer comes to a website, he usually seeks the menu first to go in search of what he needs to buy. Therefore, the menu has a very important role in making the site as easy to navigate as possible because, with its help, the customer navigates through the content and finds the product he came for.</p>
<p>When he finishes his purchase or simply wants to come back for another product, there is a “Home” page, which he comes to again by navigating through the menu. However, you should not overdo it with individual tabs in the menu so that it does not become congested, so simplicity and priority selection should be your main technique when creating a navigation menu.</p>
<h2>5. Choose Colors Carefully</h2>
<p>Choose colors for your website carefully for several reasons. First, because a balance between beauty and clarity is needed, and we will clarify what that means immediately. Colors must be relevant to the industry to which the client belongs, and in addition, the contrast between the background and the text must be such as to give the site visitor the ability to quickly and easily read the content.</p>
<p>And did you know that with the help of colors, conversions on the site can be increased? This is another reason to choose and suggest colors carefully.</p>
<h2>6. Improve the Layout of the Site</h2>
<p>It is well known that <a href="https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/mobile-desktop-internet-usage-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 55% of Internet users access sites via smartphones</a>, which they use more and which practically rarely leave their hands. That is why, if an online business wants to record increased sales of products through the site, it is important that its content is visible on all devices from which customers make a purchase (desktops, mobile phones, tablets, etc.).</p>
<p>Are you still wondering after this why it is important to understand responsive web design? We hope not.</p>
<h2>7. Pay Attention to Where You Put the CTA</h2>
<p>It is not enough to write a good copy, but also a clear and impressive CTA (call to action), which will encourage site visitors to buy something, sign up for an e-book, newsletter (whose <a href="https://www.websiteplanet.com/email-marketing-services/benchmark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subscriber’s base can be further enriched and improved</a> using web services such as Benchmark), workshop, etc.</p>
<p>However, when the copywriter does his part, suggests where to put the CTA, one of your web designers enters the scene, with the mission to turn it into an even more striking and attractive one. For that, he will again use the contrast in the choice of background colors and the box/button for the CTA.</p>
<h2>8. Make the Contact Page Accessible and Visible</h2>
<p>Most website visitors who sell a product or service believe that if contact information is not available, the brand should not be considered for further actions on their side. Also, most are not satisfied if they see only a contact form or email on this page, but want as many ways to contact the brand as possible.</p>
<p>So, do your best to enable and add live chat options for your customers, and larger companies definitely need free-of-charge numbers where customers can reach them out. If we are talking about how to add credibility to the site itself and indirectly to the brand, this is a sure way.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is important for every company, no matter what it does, to have a strong Internet presence these days. <a href="https://zeracreative.com/how-a-website-can-take-your-business-to-a-next-level/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When it comes to the success of a website</a>, there is one very simple truth to keep in mind – if you want customers to come to your site and use all its benefits, including online shopping, then that site must be easy to use.</p>
<p>If you want success, and your site is not user-friendly, then you are doing more damage to your business than benefit.</p>

<h2>1. The Better Option for Authentication and Authorization</h2>
<p>Working with millions of users on the website, it becomes essential to make sure that the client&#8217;s data is safe and secure. And that&#8217;s how you can maintain long term relationships with the customers. Laravel is providing an easier way to authorize users for any given resource from various sources. For authentication, there are some simple ways provided through Laravel Framework, and these are gates, via middleware, in the form of requests and policies.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Laravel framework has a complete authentication for Login, Password Recovery, and Registration system.</p>
<h2>2. MVC Architecture Of Laravel Framework</h2>
<p>Laravel is a PHP Web-Based Application Framework based largely upon MVC architecture. It was created for developers to get them started with working on PHP projects. Laravel presented a Model-view-controller architecture with the best PHP framework for developing web projects at ease. To perform built-in functionalities for developing mobile and web apps, developers came up with the MVC architectures model.</p>
<p>Besides this, MVC architecture has provided quality performance, advanced documentation, and various built-in functionalities compared to other PHP frameworks.</p>
<h2>3. Traffic Regulation</h2>
<p>Every business is required to drive more traffic on their websites, and that is the primary motive to build web applications so that users can use and work at their best creativity. For every business, the current situation is to drive more and more traffic because the more the traffic a web app routes, the more in a website users are there to deal with. This way, all web application hosting comes under cost-effective terms, or even sometimes, the webserver stops functioning with the loss of data.</p>
<p>A website will never desire to be in such a situation for their customers. Therefore, we figured out the best way to build your application projects using the Laravel framework. It will initially pop up a window with the message in the form of queues to keep your server up to date and healthy.</p>
<h2>4. A Powerful Support To Your Web Applications</h2>

<p>Popular frameworks, such as Laravel, have a strong community that handles the security patches to secure your website. Also, with this framework, you can manage and organize data resourcefully. However, frameworks with large accountable communities are more stable with all the latest updates.</p>
<h2>5. Error and Exception Handling for website&#8217;s better performance</h2>
<p>On the internet, there are millions of websites running. It becomes challenging for software to catch errors and exceptions when the users keep on using the website. The way an application handles exceptional errors has a significant impact on a user&#8217;s reliability for a web application. So, it becomes a duty for software to work well so that whenever a user places any error in the applications, he/she must get notified for their inconvenient action.</p>
<p>Also, if a user&#8217;s action is non-reportable and becomes unacceptable even after pressing the needed buttons, it must get reached to the user in the form of an error message. Users can blame an application for not catching correct errors and exceptions. The user can move to the next website and may never decide to return to your website ever again, especially for a business person who knows how inappropriate it feels to lose honest customers and reviews from a website.</p>

<p>Laravel frameworks work like magic for your web application project, offering you a secure code base authority. At the same time, it allows you to create the web app outstandingly.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today’s digital world, the consumer has become savvy as well as busy. They spend less and less time going through detailed websites. They are using their cell phones to access the content. The world is coming up with more and more brands, and more and more content. We all reach for our cell phones, waiting for the bus to arrive, or for food to finish warming up in the microwave. Mobile-friendly, responsive websites are key to building a brand and giving relevant content to the audience.</p>
<p>People don&#8217;t like to wait for information. Easier domain names, quicker content blocks that are easy to read, and fast-loading websites on cell phones, all help. Studies indicate that <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/metrics/2010/03/31/firefox-page-load-speed-part-i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">32% consumers would abandon a website if it is slow</a>. Studies also indicate that bounce rate can be improved by 30% if the page size is reduced, and site speed is improved.</p>
<h2>Case for Building a Responsive Website</h2>
<p>A mobile-friendly, responsive website helps your audience to check your website on various platforms and screens, from laptops and phones to tablets. The delivery of content changes but the purpose of the content does not. Do you know that there are more than <a href="https://gsmaintelligence.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four billion people</a> on this planet with cell phones? This means that a lot of your target audience lies in the realm of accessing your website through a cell phone.</p>
<p>Responsive websites mean that the structure of the website can change and adapt to the size of the screen. The user can have a better user experience in accessing your website than if it did not adapt to the type and size of the screen. The website can look good on different screens like cell phones, a tablet, or a laptop as well. Some key elements to take care of include avoiding Flash, and your text to resize instantly based on the type of screen accessing the website. To improve this user experience and to make the website responsive, all your content should be easily accessible on any device.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s search algorithms target websites that are mobile-friendly and responsive. The algorithms that came into place in 2015, give a higher ranking to websites that are responsive and mobile-friendly. For good SEO, mobile-friendly websites are preferable.</p>
<p>As a brand, having a mobile-friendly, responsive website means that you capture more users in your target niche. Any user who is not accessing your website on their computer or laptop can easily access your website on their cell phone. This means that the net of your user base can be broadened. Cutting-edge design based on modern design principles make the website appealing to the users. With strong mobile-friendliness, your website has a better brand image as well.</p>
<h2>How to Get Your Website To Be Mobile Friendly</h2>
<p>The easiest and quickest way to get a website that is mobile-friendly would be to pick up a predesigned theme from a developer or a theme foundry. You should always double-check the different versions on screens to ensure that the website shows perfectly well. If you or your developer decide on modifying the CSS, then you should ensure that responsiveness is not impacted.</p>
<p>Responsive websites need to have a few key elements that you should take care of. Responsive websites usually have a singular column, with the menu becoming more condensed for easier navigation. Colors remain the same but images are reduced to improve the speed and navigation of the website. Websites generally also have links and URLs displayed in a manner that is easy to navigate.</p>
<p>If you are not interested in a predesigned theme, you could also work on the CSS yourself, or hire a developer who has expertise in building mobile-friendly websites. Always check samples to see if the developer has experience in building websites that display well on mobile as well.</p>
<h2>Mobile Optimization Best Practices</h2>
<p>Page speed is key to mobile usage of your website. The brand-building includes several things in today&#8217;s world, and one key is having a high-speed website that is quick to load on a mobile device. Some key areas to take care of include cache, image sizes, and redirects. The cache can help load the website faster, while smaller, more optimized images and lower redirects can also boost page speed.</p>
<p>Avoid elements on your website that can impact user experience. These include Flash, pop-ups, and intricate design. If you need to show special effects, try HTML5 instead. Popups do not display well on mobile sites and are difficult to close. Complicated designs can be difficult to navigate for people with smaller screen-sized phones or fat fingers. Use CSS to develop site display options and themes so that the website can adapt itself to different screens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If your business has finally been able to muster the courage and venture into the ever-growing world of technology and mobile apps, today’s your lucky day! Before being able to hire the best studio to develop one’s dearly beloved app, it’s important to answer these 5 key questions to help one make the best of decisions.</p>
<p>The chance of one’s business skyrocketing to success is can only an app away! But first, here are some key questions to ask yourself before hiring an App Development Studio:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4737 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-scaled.jpg" alt="5 Questions You Need To Evaluate the Right App Development Studio - infographic 10 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1920" height="936" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-scaled.jpg 1920w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-300x146.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-1024x499.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-768x374.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-1536x748.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-2048x998.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-960x468.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-600x292.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-1313x640.jpg 1313w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/infographic-10-800x390.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" title="5 Questions You Need To Evaluate the Right App Development Studio 13"></p>
<h2>1. Are Their Portfolios of My Liking?</h2>
<p>Finding an App Development Studio that suits one’s requirements the best can be a lot of work as it involves skimming through various app development portfolios and searching for the most successful app developers.</p>
<p>However, if one sees something they like, it’s probably the first sign that this could be the potential “right” App Studio. Look through their portfolios, many of which can be found on their websites, and see whether their work fits with what one has in mind for their own future business’ app. Be observant of how much progress they have made in the past year and whether they specialize in the industry that one requires (e.g. Fitness, Social Media or Games).</p>
<p>Not only that, but check the reviews for their apps online at the <a href="https://www.google.com.pk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV24TCuazXAhUGqo8KHSGeDwQQFggjMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%3Fhl%3Den&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Yjl1oQSF0yePbWWRpp2jt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Store</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com.pk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV4cjMuazXAhUJpI8KHfppDPQQFggjMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fgenre%2Fios%2Fid36%3Fmt%3D8&amp;usg=AOvVaw34cC7wO8XCwshkhf59tXG3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AppStore</a>. Do their customers complain of bugs and lagging of the app? Have they made improvements to their app after all the complaints? How many stars have people given their apps? Do extensive research regarding what various studios have put out into the world of apps and how successful have they been?</p>
<p>If one likes what they see, this is an indication of having answered the first essential question before hiring an App Development studio.</p>
<h2>2. Who Are Their Past and Present Clients? Are They Satisfied?</h2>
<p>Take a look at who their clients were and currently are. Get in touch with them, contact this studio’s clients and don’t be afraid to ask. Get to know how their experience was. Was it amazing? Was it satisfactory or was it horrid? Ask them about the challenges they faced, how the studio dealt with them as a client and would they be open to working with this studio again?</p>
<p>By digging deep and finding out others’ hands-on experience, one will be able to get an idea of what it would be like to work with this particular studio. This is how the second question regarding hiring the dream app development studio is answered.</p>
<p>Not only will this help in narrowing one’s decision as to which studios to worth spending time on, but it will help give one a clear idea of what kind of experience as well as a response they require by hiring a particular studio.</p>
<h2>3. What Platform Are They Capable of Developing For?</h2>
<p>If one aims to make an app accessible to all customers and users, what is the best platform to make it available on? If one already has a platform in mind, does this particular App Development Studio allow the business to release an app on it? Getting to know if the studio has the ability to develop an app that is more suited for iOS or Android users? Will the app be available to users of all devices or just some? Will the app be available worldwide or only in the Pakistan?</p>
<p>These questions are important to ask as well as answer in order to hire a studio that is able to fulfill the technical requirements.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=477687" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4223" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/58da17cf.jpg" alt="5 Questions You Need To Evaluate the Right App Development Studio - 58da17cf - Zera Creative" width="900" height="90" title="5 Questions You Need To Evaluate the Right App Development Studio 14"></a></p>
<h2>4. How Much Time Will It Take?</h2>
<p>How long will one be willing to wait for their dream app to be made? And how long will the App Development Studio take? If there’s a deadline that needs to be met, will this trusted studio be able to make it in time? Be sure to ask how practical it is for this studio to be able to produce what you want in the amount of time specified by them. If this particular studio is not too sure about delivering what one requires, look to hire another studio that can promise an efficient, quick, and responsible service.</p>
<p>Also, evaluate if support is provided after the development work is completed. If the warranty period is missing, or if support and maintenance are not provided, then it is time to look for a studio that does.</p>
<p>Maintenance and support can help with changes, new feature addition, and any updates that may be required due to OS updates. Zera Creative provides up to <a href="https://zeracreative.com/monthly-website-maintenance-service-pakistan/">3 months of free maintenance support</a> post-delivery, after which it provides support and maintenance at reasonable rates.</p>
<h2>5. How Much Will It Cost? Is This Studio Budget-Friendly?</h2>
<p>Now, this is an important question to ask. A lot of the time, companies and studios can be very promising and successful; however, they can be way out of the business’ budget. It’s better to choose a small, affordable studio rather than hiring an over-the-top, expensive, popular studio that leaves one in debt.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is essential to ask oneself whether hiring this studio will allow one to still remain within their financial boundaries.</p>
<h2>6. Will The App Make Money? How Will The Profit Be Split?</h2>
<p>Another important thing to consider asking is if the mobile app makes revenue, how much will the Studio charge? Will there be a 50-50 split on profit? It is important to decide how much is to be charged for the development of the app so that a studio can be hired that is able to deliver as well as keep their promise of charging fairly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, it can be said that hiring the <a href="https://zeracreative.com">perfect App Development Studio</a> takes time, effort, and in-depth research about what one actually expects from the launch of a mobile application. Nevertheless, if one looks hard and long enough, they’ll find what they’re looking for.</p>

<p>We live in a world that is dominated by technology. The things we see, the work we do, and the way we interact with the things around us, are all impacted by technology. On one hand, where this huge inheritance of innovation is making lives more convenient, it is also opening up a higher level of clutter amongst organizations that revolve their businesses around these technologies.</p>
<p>The most recent innovation that is sweeping every industry off its feet is <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artificial Intelligence</a></strong>. While it has a been a while since AI made its arrival; it is now that every industry is actually embracing its potential.</p>
<p>Amongst all, the one industry that has one of the most customer-centric workings is E-Commerce. Many e-commerce businesses have already inculcated Artificial Intelligence in their organizations and are catering to better results.</p>
<p>In this blog, we have covered the influence of <strong>AI on e-commerce businesses</strong>, and the different ways in which organizations use it.</p>
<h2><strong>Defining the Concept of Artificial Intelligence</strong></h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence demonstrates the machines that are intelligent and capable enough to perform tasks and function on their own. The machines that assimilate AI are designed in a way that they can think and behave like a human.</p>
<p>This capability has given a rise to businesses in choosing to integrate with Artificial Intelligence, in order to enhance their overall efficiency and productivity. Over the years, the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/607716/worldwide-artificial-intelligence-market-revenues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">market for AI has seen a tremendous rise</a>; in 2016, the global market of AI was approximately worth 3,221 billion US dollars. As of 2025, it will reach approximately 89,847 billion US dollars.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4760 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infographic-21-scaled.jpg" alt="How is Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce? - infographic 21 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1920" height="1145" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infographic-21-scaled.jpg 1811w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infographic-21-300x179.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infographic-21-1024x611.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infographic-21-768x458.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infographic-21-1536x916.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infographic-21-2048x1222.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infographic-21-960x573.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infographic-21-600x358.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infographic-21-1073x640.jpg 1073w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infographic-21-800x477.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" title="How is Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce? 22"></p>
<h2><strong>Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>In the current scenario of the market where AI is bringing forth a lot of opportunities, being innovative is the key to success. The importance that this technology is getting has edged marketers to integrate AI into their business.</p>
<p>Following are some of the most common techniques in which <a href="/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>app development companies</strong></a> are making use of AI.</p>
<h3><strong>Using Chatbots</strong>:</h3>
<p>Over the years, there has been a rapid shift in the focus of businesses in regard to the users. Initially, it stood at catering to a bigger market, but it has now come to generate a great experience for the users. Many retailers have taken a better understanding of Artificial Intelligence and are incorporating techniques like Chatbots to improve the experience of users.</p>
<p>Now, what exactly is a Chatbot? In the most basic terms, a bot is a computer program that has been developed in a way that it indulges in conversations with the users in a completely human-like manner.</p>
<p>Big brands like H&amp;M, Amazon &amp; Walmart completely depend on chatbots for answering to the queries of the customers. Because the bots answer in a very conversational way (even though they are supposed to be mechanical), they have been gaining a lot of popularity. So much, so that when a user talks to the bot, it creates an illusion that a human is answering the queries!</p>
<p>Also, bots give very instant responses, eliminating the chances of users having to wait for a long period of time.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1933 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hm-chatbot.png" alt="How is Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce? - hm chatbot - Zera Creative" width="750" height="332" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hm-chatbot.png 750w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hm-chatbot-300x133.png 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hm-chatbot-600x266.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" title="How is Artificial Intelligence Impacting E-Commerce? 23"></p>
<p>Chatbots are connected with Artificial Intelligence and are hence trained to answer questions in the most relevant manner. It understands and learns from the interactions it has with users, stores them, and uses them to give answers in the future.</p>
<p>The best part about bots is that it not only improve the experience of users on the app, it is also increasing the productivity of the organization. Bots are efficiently saving the time of the employee who otherwise would have been delegated to respond to these queries of users!</p>
<h3><strong>Managing the inventory in organizations</strong>:</h3>
<p>The constant pain that employees face is keeping a track of everything in an organization. Be it as small as a pin, you will have to keep the inventory up to date. The predictive nature of Artificial Intelligence has taken care of managing the inventory!</p>
<p>Based on the working of AI, it collects and analyses the important factors that drive the demand for major requirements in the market, predicts what their future demands would be, and that gives the organizations a benefit in knowing their inventory needs!</p>
<h3><strong>Easier customer searches:</strong></h3>
<p>If we look at it from the perspective of the users, it is very difficult to find the exact thing that you are looking for. Of course, users can spend hours on search engines trying to find what they are looking for, but the chances of coming across that exact thing are slight.</p>
<p>Thanks to the tech-friendly world we are living in, Artificial Intelligence has the perfect solution for this! AI assists the customers in finding what they were looking for in a much more natural way.</p>
<p>Take for instance, in the app <a href="https://www.gofind.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go Find</a>, you can take a picture of whatever you like. The app will bring similar-looking results from its stores.</p>
<p>The Echo Look by Amazon uses a camera integrated with Artificial Intelligence. It gives recommendations about what looks best on the user!</p>
<p>The whole concept of AI is eliminating the need for typing search words to look for something. It is now shifting to using visuals to complete that task, making the process more interesting.</p>

<h3><strong>Create an interactive sales process</strong>:</h3>
<p>Given the high level of competition in every domain today, it is pretty difficult to reach out to the customers and offer them the most appropriate services. Which is why the integration of Artificial Intelligence in managing the customers’ time efficiently. It understands the choices of the users before providing any customized solutions.</p>
<p>Also, it deploys the time of the users only in the areas required. It also ensures that they don’t see any inappropriate products. For instance, The North Face uses “IBM Watson”. It asks the users choice-related questions like “Where will you be using the jacket?”. Based on the answers, it brings forth the most relevant products.</p>
<h3><strong>Channeling a new level of personalization</strong>:</h3>
<p>Regardless of who the user is or what they want, they would want a personalized experience on the app. Rather than generalizing the needs of the users, the algorithms of Artificial Intelligence can be utilized to cater the personalized content for the users. That would give them a better and more optimized experience.</p>
<p>This can be illustrated by an example; suppose a user is browsing for a superhero tee on a website from their laptop. Now, they can receive advertisements about any offers or sales related to that search when they open any social media platform (eg. Facebook, Instagram) from their mobile phone as well.</p>
