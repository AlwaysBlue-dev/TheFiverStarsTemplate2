										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The company profile is a short description of your business. It&#8217;s a way to introduce your company and its products or services to the world, helping people understand what you do and how they can get in touch with you. You can use it as an opportunity to build trust with clients who don&#8217;t know much about you yet, or even as an opportunity for them to learn more about who they&#8217;re buying from.</p>
<p>Company profiles are also good for marketing purposes: by showing off what makes your enterprise unique (or similar), potential clients will be more likely to open up about their needs—and that&#8217;s when sales come in!</p>
<p>A company profile can be written in a number of different ways. You could write it yourself or hire someone to do it for you. The most important thing is that there must be consistency between all of your company profiles so that people know what they are buying when they look at one website or another.</p>
<h2>Benefits of a Company Profile </h2>
<p>Company profile is important for large as well as for small businesses that want to grow fast. It helps you stand out from the competition, attract new customers and build trust with your existing ones. The pursuing are some of the advantages;</p>
<ul>
<li>It serves as a great marketing tool</li>
<li>Helps your company stand out</li>
<li>Builds brand awareness &#038; credibility</li>
<li>Gives a sentiment about your products and services</li>
<li>Helps in the recruitment process</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use a company profile to increase sales by <a href="https://www.digitaltrails.co.uk/10-steps-to-create-and-maintain-a-positive-brand-image/" target="_blank" title="company profile design service" rel="noopener">creating a positive brand image</a> for your business. This will help customers choose products or services from you over competitors because they know that what you sell is good quality or genuine in nature.</p>
<p>You can use the company profile as a marketing tool to attract more customers by displaying information about how much money was spent on advertising campaigns, how many people attended events etc., which shows them how committed these companies are toward their customers’ satisfaction levels (and thus increases chances of making repeat purchases).</p>
<h2>How to Create a Company Profile</h2>
<p>A company profile is a summary of your business. It should be short and concise, clear and easy to understand, and have a good visual design. The information you provide should be up-to-date at all times so that potential customers can see what you are offering right now in the marketplace as well as look forward to future plans.</p>
<p>A company profile should be written in simple English text with no technical terms or jargon. The graphics and images used in the company profile must be top-notch with attention to detail. It should not be overly long as it will not be read by many people including potential customers or clients who might contact you for services or products. </p>
<p>If possible, try to use an even amount of slides, images, and text so that there is sufficient room for other important information such as contact details and website URL address, etc.</p>

<h2>Pros and Cons of a Company Profile </h2>
<p>A company profile is a document that outlines the history of a company and its mission. It&#8217;s often used by potential investors or business partners to get an idea of what a company does and how it works.

<h3>Pros </h3>

It should be easy to read, but also provide details about what you&#8217;re passionate about as an organization and what makes you special. A good company profile will show that you understand your target audience—which is why it&#8217;s so important for businesses that want to stand out in their field!</p>

The process of creating a company profile can be time-consuming, so if you&#8217;re looking for something quick and easy, this might not be for you. Creating a company profile is expensive—you&#8217;ll need someone who has expertise in writing about businesses or startups (or both) who will charge per hour based on their estimate of how long it takes them to complete each task they are asked to do by your organization(s).</p>
<h2>Is a Company Profile Really Important for a Business? </h2>
<p><strong>The answer is yes</strong>, a company profile is really important for a business.</p>

<p>Company profile is really important for small businesses that want to grow fast. It helps potential customers to understand your company and product better, build trust with them, create brand awareness and grow your business.</p>
<p>When having a company profile on LinkedIn, helps people find out more about you so that they can get in touch with you if they have any questions or need assistance with something corresponding to what you do.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AI wonders are making graphic design agencies giddy with excitement and terrifying them at the same time. Its massive transformation into the tech world has shaken numerous industries and the design world is no exception.</p>
<p>Where newbies fear AI to be a substitute, professionals know how to leverage its full capacities. So, if you are wondering how the technology can help transform the design industry and what ways AI can assist an ethical designer, here&#8217;s the blog to find your answers.</p>
<h2>Growth and Application of AI Across Major Industries</h2>
<p>AI has experienced a snowballing adoption rate over the years due to its uncompromising efficiency and advances. According to the <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/3104/artificial-intelligence-ai-worldwide/#dossierKeyfigures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statista report</a>, the global market size reached $327.5 billion in 2021.</p>
<p>Whereas, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-11-22-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-artificial-intelligence-software-market-to-reach-62-billion-in-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner</a> predicted AI software to reach $62 billion in 2022 alone. The global annual revenue of AI software currently is around $50 billion, see below:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4349" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies.png" alt="Future of AI Designs: Guide For Graphic Design Agencies - future of ai designs guide for graphic design agencies - Zera Creative" width="532" height="391" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies.png 532w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies-300x220.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px" title="Future of AI Designs: Guide For Graphic Design Agencies 5"></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.tractica.com/research/artificial-intelligence-market-forecasts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Omdia</a></p>
<p>AI software integrates a business with its uncountable benefits. Reduced operational time, greater business insights, automation, enhanced productivity and reduced human error are some it powers up any business.</p>
<p>At present, tech giants such as Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft are spending billions of dollars on AI products and services. However, considering the potential of Artificial Intelligence, universities are making it a prominent part of their curricula. All the major industries have now untapped the undeniable significance and the role of AI to influence innovation and advancements in terms of productivity, security and efficiency. So, how does AI transform the design industry? Let&#8217;s dive deep below:</p>
<h2>Future of AI Designs: Rising Above the Hype</h2>
<p>To let AI assist graphic design agencies with its full capacity and potential there is a need to first deconstruct it. Instead of thinking about AI as <strong>“artificial intelligence”</strong>– a substitute, consider it as <strong>“augmented intelligence”</strong>. Designers need to conceptualise AI as a tool that augments the level of intelligence in a service in terms of its overall quality or productivity.</p>
<p>AI bots are not replacing designers but instead assisting them in terms of optimization and speed. A designer using AI software tends to create designs faster and with greater proficiency. AI bots have the power to analyze vast amounts of data and offer accurate suggestions to enable a designer to create a most engaging and industry-specific design.</p>
<h3>Speedy Design Prototyping</h3>
<p>With the help of AI tools, designers can create multiple prototype versions that can be A/B tested with users. The tools assist in scanning basic sketches for speedy design prototyping. In the AI tool users enter a few parameters and get a library full of UI components that provide a prototype which is aligned with the company&#8217;s design system. Airbnb is one of those early adopters who are using this technology to generate design components using computer vision-enabled AI and machine learning.</p>
<h3>Seamless Product Localization</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4350" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies-zera-creative.png" alt="Future of AI Designs: Guide For Graphic Design Agencies - future of ai designs guide for graphic design agencies zera creative - Zera Creative" width="670" height="234" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies-zera-creative.png 670w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies-zera-creative-300x105.png 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies-zera-creative-600x210.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" title="Future of AI Designs: Guide For Graphic Design Agencies 6"></p>
<p>AI has introduced game-changing models to integrate personalization in the design industry. Google, Facebook and Netflix have been using AI technology to capture the attention of their users and keep them engrossed in their platforms. Two major problems that every designer has encountered were product localisation and the translation of a design into multiple languages, both of these issues are now fully catered to by AI.</p>
<p>Google’s neural machine translation embedded AI bots allows users instantly translate visual information into another language. Moreover, Netflix is leveraging AI to localization of show banners into different languages along with artwork personalization. With AI bots the localized and personalized graphics are instantly created without there need for designers to spend time on them. All that is needed is a skim through to approve or reject the design if necessary.</p>
<h3>Unique Packaging Designs</h3>
<p>A human mind may seize to restrict its capabilities under a certain condition or situation. For instance, for a designer to create multiple unique copies for the same brand having the same ideology is a bit complicated. However, with the help of AI, a professional can commit millions of unique designs with each having incredibly engaging creativity.</p>
<p>The AI algorithms untapped dozens of distinctive patterns, colours and aesthetics creating seven million unique <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2017/06/01/algorithm-seven-million-different-jars-nutella-packaging-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">packaging designs for Nutella</a>. It accelerated the product sales that were presented with captivating designs printed on the front of each jar in Italy. The technology usurped the traditional role of a graphic designer to spend hours creating unique designs.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4351" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/nutella-ai-packaging.png" alt="Future of AI Designs: Guide For Graphic Design Agencies - nutella ai packaging - Zera Creative" width="412" height="392" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/nutella-ai-packaging.png 412w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/nutella-ai-packaging-300x285.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px" title="Future of AI Designs: Guide For Graphic Design Agencies 7"></p>
<h2>The Need For Graphic Designers To Co-Create With AI</h2>
<p>AI design software enables designers to produce eye-catching designs faster and quicker. The bots refine a product&#8217;s image by successfully comparing it with millions of others. it helps in generating enhanced user engagements.</p>
<p>Moreover, by incorporating a personalized touch into the designs brands can generate an accelerated ROI. AI targets multiple data points to fully comprehend a user&#8217;s journey and enables designers the rich data to create the most targetted designs.</p>
<p>AI using facial recognition is able to determine age, gender, context, location and the current mood of users. With this data, a UX designer can target the audience more efficiently.<br />
According to the research, the use of digital assistance by 2021 would reach 1.8B. Hence, with the use of coupling AI and voice recognition, UX designers are able to create speedier and more efficient designs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, AI enables designers to leverage usability metrics. It processes a large amount of data that results in the creation of high-performing designs for products. Lastly, by co-creating with AI, designers can ponder on how users read and look at data that can help them in paying more attention to important areas to target.</p>
<h3>Key Giveaways</h3>

<p>Experience is one of the most vital points that give web agencies a competitive edge over others. The more experience a firm has, the better is the service. Experience comes in handy when there are issues and challenges with the design. Experienced professionals can tackle problems more productively than others.</p>
<h2>8. Pricing and Cost</h2>
<p>Cost plays a big role in any step of the business. If you are getting service at higher prices than you could get in a lower one, that’s a loss one should avoid. Always see the pricing that includes all the charges and none are hidden. But never compromise the quality of the website as it is your investment. If you go for cheaper prices and compromise the quality, you may have to pay a price that would hurt you a lot.</p>
<p>These were some tips and thoughts you should always keep in mind before choosing a <a href="https://zeracreative.com/website-development-company-in-karachi-pakistan/">web design agency</a>. These factors will determine your place in this world of virtual reality.</p>

<p>Here are 5 steps to follow in order to find your dream design studio:</p>
<h2>1. Keep The End Goal in Mind</h2>
<p>When looking for a design studio, keep in mind the requirements of your business needs. What is your aim after hiring them? How will this studio propel your business’s success? Remember the end goal of hiring a design studio for your business; this could be something along the lines of</p>
<ul>
<li>Initiate a new type of brand advertising which will create greater recognition for the business as well as generate monthly revenue and profits</li>
<li>Using the help of rebranding to increase sales by 10-20%</li>
<li>Developing a customer-centric mobile app that works to build customer engagement</li>
<li>Enhance <a href="https://zeracreative.com/best-seo-company-in-karachi/">SEO</a> of your blog to increase the visibility of your website to the world</li>
</ul>
<p>When you have set these goals, it is important that you note the areas of expertise your shortlisted design studios offer. Do they offer the services that will help you to meet these goals? Do they have the right portfolio to support these services? How popular is its social media presence? Are their testimonials supporting their services as well?</p>
<p>Make sure while hiring the design studio, that it not only “looks good,” but it has to be more specific, detailed, and much more meaningful. Write down a few goals and check which agency provides the greatest potential and ability to help the business out.</p>
<h2>2. Get Inspired</h2>
<p>Find popular, well-known agencies and <a href="https://zeracreative.com/branding-logo-design-company-pakistan/">design studios</a> and sift through their work. Does it serve as an inspiration? Is it in line with what you want your business to look like, or is your <a href="https://zeracreative.com/wordpress-development-company/">website</a> or mobile app, branding, exactly in line with what you have in mind? Find a particular design, font, layout, logo, colors, and inspirational images that catch your eye and which depict the feel of what you want from your brand, etc.</p>
<p>The more specific you are with your choices and inspirational feel, the greater the possibility of finding the best-suited studio. You can always go to Pinterest to decide on your inspiration.</p>
<h2>3. Start Searching</h2>
<p>Once proper outlines have been made regarding finding the best studio, it’s time to start searching. Now, this may take some work. First, start with one’s inner circle and business colleagues. Ask around about who knows of a few design studios and whether they can help out with getting in touch with them. Next, try searching online. Although Google may have innumerable results for the words “design studio,” try putting in one’s location to narrow down and find specific, helpful results.</p>
<p>Check out their <a href="https://zeracreative.com/work/">portfolios</a> and websites, see what one likes and delve further into the details. Do they update their website frequently? Do they have good reviews from their clients?  Look at which businesses they’ve worked for in the past and how successful have they been in giving their clients what they want.</p>
<p>By going through all this effort, finding a design studio that identifies with the business’ beliefs, ideologies, and guarantees to deliver become much easier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=477687" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4223" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/58da17cf.jpg" alt="5 Steps to Follow to Hire a Great Design Studio for your Business - 58da17cf - Zera Creative" width="900" height="90" title="5 Steps to Follow to Hire a Great Design Studio for your Business 13"></a></p>
<h2>4. Make The First Move</h2>
<p>Once you’ve narrowed down which design studios suit the business the best, start contacting them. The most common and efficient method is by picking up the phone or e-mailing the agencies. If composing an e-mail, make it formal as well as precise and make sure to leave all of your contact details so they can reach back easily.</p>
<p>Try and contact as many studios as possible, so that if one doesn’t respond, another surely will. Give every agency a full week to reply back, just in case they are busy with other clients. Once the replies come in, pay close attention to which agency responds best and which one makes the best connection with you. Comparing responses helps to decide which studio is more invested in working with you.</p>
<h2>5. Cost Effective</h2>
<p>One very important factor involved in finding the best designer studio is to consider the costs. Make sure that the preferred studio and your business are on the same page when it comes to the cost of producing and designing through the studio.</p>
<p>If you are a small start-up then the best studio would be the one that works on a small scale in a more affordable manner. It is essential that the budget is discussed before finalizing which designer studio to choose from. This way, finding the best designer studio becomes a whole lot easier and more effective!</p>
<p>Overall, it can be said that finding the best design studio that suits one’s needs will take time and research. But once the dream studio is found, a lovely partnership blossoms, guaranteeing success and growth for both, the studio and the business.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today’s digital world, the consumer has become savvy as well as busy. They spend less and less time going through detailed websites. They are using their cell phones to access the content. The world is coming up with more and more brands, and more and more content. We all reach for our cell phones, waiting for the bus to arrive, or for food to finish warming up in the microwave. Mobile-friendly, responsive websites are key to building a brand and giving relevant content to the audience.</p>
<p>People don&#8217;t like to wait for information. Easier domain names, quicker content blocks that are easy to read, and fast-loading websites on cell phones, all help. Studies indicate that <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/metrics/2010/03/31/firefox-page-load-speed-part-i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">32% consumers would abandon a website if it is slow</a>. Studies also indicate that bounce rate can be improved by 30% if the page size is reduced, and site speed is improved.</p>
<h2>Case for Building a Responsive Website</h2>
<p>A mobile-friendly, responsive website helps your audience to check your website on various platforms and screens, from laptops and phones to tablets. The delivery of content changes but the purpose of the content does not. Do you know that there are more than <a href="https://gsmaintelligence.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four billion people</a> on this planet with cell phones? This means that a lot of your target audience lies in the realm of accessing your website through a cell phone.</p>
<p>Responsive websites mean that the structure of the website can change and adapt to the size of the screen. The user can have a better user experience in accessing your website than if it did not adapt to the type and size of the screen. The website can look good on different screens like cell phones, a tablet, or a laptop as well. Some key elements to take care of include avoiding Flash, and your text to resize instantly based on the type of screen accessing the website. To improve this user experience and to make the website responsive, all your content should be easily accessible on any device.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s search algorithms target websites that are mobile-friendly and responsive. The algorithms that came into place in 2015, give a higher ranking to websites that are responsive and mobile-friendly. For good SEO, mobile-friendly websites are preferable.</p>
<p>As a brand, having a mobile-friendly, responsive website means that you capture more users in your target niche. Any user who is not accessing your website on their computer or laptop can easily access your website on their cell phone. This means that the net of your user base can be broadened. Cutting-edge design based on modern design principles make the website appealing to the users. With strong mobile-friendliness, your website has a better brand image as well.</p>
<h2>How to Get Your Website To Be Mobile Friendly</h2>
<p>The easiest and quickest way to get a website that is mobile-friendly would be to pick up a predesigned theme from a developer or a theme foundry. You should always double-check the different versions on screens to ensure that the website shows perfectly well. If you or your developer decide on modifying the CSS, then you should ensure that responsiveness is not impacted.</p>
<p>Responsive websites need to have a few key elements that you should take care of. Responsive websites usually have a singular column, with the menu becoming more condensed for easier navigation. Colors remain the same but images are reduced to improve the speed and navigation of the website. Websites generally also have links and URLs displayed in a manner that is easy to navigate.</p>
<p>If you are not interested in a predesigned theme, you could also work on the CSS yourself, or hire a developer who has expertise in building mobile-friendly websites. Always check samples to see if the developer has experience in building websites that display well on mobile as well.</p>
<h2>Mobile Optimization Best Practices</h2>
<p>Page speed is key to mobile usage of your website. The brand-building includes several things in today&#8217;s world, and one key is having a high-speed website that is quick to load on a mobile device. Some key areas to take care of include cache, image sizes, and redirects. The cache can help load the website faster, while smaller, more optimized images and lower redirects can also boost page speed.</p>
<p>Avoid elements on your website that can impact user experience. These include Flash, pop-ups, and intricate design. If you need to show special effects, try HTML5 instead. Popups do not display well on mobile sites and are difficult to close. Complicated designs can be difficult to navigate for people with smaller screen-sized phones or fat fingers. Use CSS to develop site display options and themes so that the website can adapt itself to different screens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brands today popup and they go. This is because the attention span of the average consumer is far less than it has ever been. It is also because there is so much clutter in the media and digital space, that it is difficult to stand out easily. Big, traditional brands, that we have encountered and used for decades have closed down for various reasons. We are all familiar with Pan Am, Nokia, Enron, all of which have closed down for various reasons. We now know tons of brands in the digital age as well, some of which have grown tremendously in the past few years, like Facebook, WordPress, Google, and more. Exactly what is branding, why do we need them, especially in today&#8217;s digital age, how do products and services become a great brand?</p>
<h2>What Is A Brand Anyway?</h2>
<p>A brand is an idea or a persona that customers or your target audiences associate with a product or service. The Brand Name, Logo or Slogan become stimulants for the identification of a brand created by any company or business.  Sometimes, brands are associated with simply the logo or the slogan that a company may build around a product or service.</p>
<p>But branding is much more than that. It is a differentiating factor between your products versus your competitor. It is also the entire persona that you build around your product or service. The image is a combination of symbols, references, and terms for customers to identify your product or service against others. Smaller elements like customer servicing scripts, colors used, and the kind of graphics you create to depict your brand, all add up to the persona of your product or service.</p>
<h2>Why Would You Need Branding?</h2>
<p>Branding your product and service is key to building trust and comfort in your audience to purchase from you rather than a competitor or an alternative. Branding gives you uniqueness and can build recognition amongst your audiences. With a stronger brand, you can add a premium to your pricing too, hence, you must need a good <a href="https://www.designrush.com/agency/logo-branding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">branding agency</a> for your business. Think big brands that you pay a premium for like Apple, or Rolls Royce. Consider it this way. Your brand can add great value to your company, over and above the physical assets and trademarks. For example, Coca-Cola&#8217;s brand value in 2014 was worth USD 67 million, which was more than 50% of the share&#8217;s value at that time!</p>
<p>For small businesses, a great brand can help with recognition and recall of your services and products. More so, it adds value to your business because of the trust factor that continues to build alongside a great brand. Great branding can add to referrals to your business too as customers talk about your brand in positive terms with others. Therefore, a strong brand can help you with adding significant value to your business.</p>
<h2>Key Ways to Build a Great Brand:</h2>
<p>To build a great brand think like the end customer. Identify the needs of your specific target audience that your brand will satisfy. The specific kind of thought, emotion, drive, and feeling that you want in your audience, is what your brand should stand out for and be about.</p>
<p>Here are some key ways of building a great brand in today’s competitive global marketplace:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define your Brand: Come up with at least 3-5 keywords that define your product instantly. Define the various thoughts and moods that your brand will stand out for. These thoughts and moods are represented by some of these elements. These elements invoke certain thoughts and emotions in the mind of the target audience:
<ul>
<li>Logo and its design concept</li>
<li>Colors that represent the feeling and emotions that you want to invoke in your audience</li>
<li>Values, references, and terms that your brand represents</li>
<li>Graphic elements and font styles that represent your brand</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Position your Brand: The specific target audience should be able to relate to your brand and should be able to engage with it. To position your brand, some key guidelines include:
<ul>
<li>Is your target audience able to relate to you and your brand?</li>
<li>Do they need to think about your brand to recall it?</li>
<li>Do they need to spend time and thought to be able to understand it?</li>
<li>Does your brand depict the uniqueness that you are offering in your products and services?</li>
<li>Is your brand able to reflect the values that you have planned out for your products and services to depict?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Be Consistent with your Brand: Once your brand name is in place, and you&#8217;ve decided on your positioning strategy, you should use it everywhere consistently. All print and digital communication should reflect the consistent communication of your brand. Inconsistent branding often results in low recognition, low demand, and confusion in the audience. If you are launching your online platforms, it is best to match your brand name with the web address you are opting for.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://zeracreative.com/branding-logo-design-company-pakistan/">Branding </a>your product is a one-time investment that pays dividends in the long run. It sets the tone right and reaches out to customers, one at a time.</p>
