It is a differentiating factor between your products versus your competitor. It is also the entire persona that you build around your product or service. The image is a\u00a0combination of symbols, references, and terms for customers to identify your product or service against others. Smaller elements like customer servicing scripts, colors used,\u00a0and the kind of graphics you create to depict your brand, all add up to the persona of your product or service.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Would You Need Branding?<\/h2>\n<p>Branding your product and service is key to building trust and comfort in your audience to purchase from you rather than a competitor or an alternative.
