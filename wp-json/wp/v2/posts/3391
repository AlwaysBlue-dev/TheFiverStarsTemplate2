Well Designed and Functional<\/h2>\n<p>Website aesthetics and design play a huge role to give off a professional look. It doesn\u2019t need to go overboard and create something out of the ordinary. But the design theme, choice of colour, and meaningful graphics should be effective for the target market.<\/p>\n<p>All these aspects are necessary to grab attention, portray a coherent message, and give a pleasant experience. Also, it adds to the vitality of conversions. Since every single graphical aspect is important for better conversions.<\/p>\n<p>Next, a website must have a purpose that binds the overall design together, and that\u2019s functionality. Suppose one opts in by giving their email address. Upon opting, they\u2019re being directed to XYZ place. That XYZ place, or the following location, you direct them to should be thoroughly planned out. In other words, where do they appear next after their initial action?<\/p>\n<p>Everything in the process must be sleek and bound with a purpose-designed functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Does WordPress have?<\/p>\n<p>You better believe it &#8211; WordPress offers over 3500 GPL-licensed themes. These themes are designed differently by keeping different business needs and purposes in mind. Further, WordPress is an open-source website where you can customize your website to your needs. (Caveat: That involves a bit of technical knowledge)<\/p>\n<p>Done with design and functionality. Let\u2019s move on to navigation.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Smooth Navigation<\/h2>\n<p>Smooth navigation adds to the appearance aspect that gives users a convenient experience. Advisably, the limited number of items with proper navigations in menus is better for user experience.<\/p>\n<p>From the home page to the last page, all the breadcrumbs navigations need to be as intuitive as possible. Suppose your customer lands on the product page; it must have clear navigation to the home page and vice versa. An easy-to-use interface with intuitive navigation almost always spells out everything, which is a smart approach to increasing conversion rate.<\/p>\n<p>With WordPress themes, simplified navigation is possible. Themes have their own preset navigations. Plus, some plugins would further help with customized navigations.<\/p>\n<p>However, if your website is big and has a lot going on, you better require technical knowledge to further customize it.<\/p>\n<p>Great, you have impeccable and sleek navigations, but what if your customers never get to see your website?<\/p>\n<h2>3. Website Page Speed (Load time)<\/h2>\n<p>A good professional website loads fast. No matter how amazing aesthetics your website has if it doesn&#8217;t load your customers would bounce off before ever experiencing it.<\/p>\n<p>Scary, isn\u2019t it?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/hostingtribunal.com\/blog\/how-speed-affects-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Research by Hosting tribunal<\/a> shows the importance of 1s delay in website loading.<\/p>\n<p>1-second delay accounts for 11% reduce page views. 16% customer satisfaction plummets by 1s site load delay. 1s delay swipes away 17% of the coveted conversion rate.<\/p>\n<p>Have you ever thought of that? Interesting! In the bigger scheme of things, these numbers are large. 17% conversion rate just by increasing the site load speed by 1s. Crazy! Flip the script, 17% less in profits if it takes 1 extra second. Lots more to think about.<\/p>\n<p>For every professional website we ever worked on, we make sure it loads fast. This not only adds to the professionalism but also affects overall website performance on search engines.<\/p>\n<p>With WordPress, you can reduce site speed by using a fast-loading theme, using fewer plugins, shortening picture size that better optimize, emptying trash, reducing post revisions, drafts, and trackbacks, Enable Gzip compression, Minify and combining CSS and JavaScript, Enabling Browser caching, and install a cache plugin.<\/p>\n<p>Here, you need to be vigilant, any rogue plug-in would reduce your website speed. Nonetheless, a perfect blend is what everyone should aim for.<\/p>\n<p>Conceivably, you\u2019ve checked in all those boxes still your website would remain slow.<\/p>\n<p>Why?<\/p>\n<p>Because of your web hosting. Choosing the right hosting plan impacts a lot on site speed. This\u2019s an important element for a professional website.<\/p>\n<h2>4. It should be SEO Optimized<\/h2>\n<p>If your website doesn\u2019t show up in search results, would it make sense of anything we discuss above?<\/p>\n<p>In today\u2019s fast-paced internet world, it\u2019s oddly important to optimize websites for better SERPs rankings. That requires constant testing, on-page, and Off-Page SEO optimization, Keywords Optimization, better HTML and CSS coding, Minifying JavaScripts and CSS codes, proper navigations, and much more<\/p>\n<p>There goes a lot of technical programming knowledge to better optimize websites for search engines.<\/p>\n<p>Every professional website is SEO optimized. The reason is, that the better the optimized website, the more relevant customers land on your website.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s suppose you want to rank for \u201cVegan Diet\u201d as you are selling a vegan diet book through the blog. You craft world-class content, do all the SEO, and secure the topmost Google position. By staying on top, you\u2019d have 750 prospects landing on your website every single month. Doesn\u2019t it make your profit register ring?<\/p>\n<p>With WordPress, SEO customization is easy, concerning that you know the technical side of things, and how to minify CSS and JavaScript coding, photo optimization, and a few other aspects.<\/p>\n<p>All in all, WordPress is easily optimized. That&#8217;s why <strong>WordPress websites dominate Google SERPs by a long shot<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Ok! Got it. Your website is SEO optimized for the web but does it also optimize for mobile<\/p>\n<h2>5. Mobile Optimized<\/h2>\n<p>The searches on mobile have surged, and now every other query is being searched on a mobile or desktop. This means around <strong>50%<\/strong> of consumers are using mobile to search for queries.<\/p>\n<p>That implicitly claims that if your website is not responsive and isn&#8217;t fully optimized for both laptop and mobile\/tablet, chances for high profits margin would diminish, which results in an upset consumer base. Google&#8217;s study reveals 48% of mobile consumers who visit a non-friendly mobile website, would think that the company is not serious about the business.<\/p>\n<p>That largely adds to the professionalism of a website.<\/p>\n<p>Regarding WordPress. Yes! WordPress <a href=\"https:\/\/zeracreative.com\/case-mobile-friendly-responsive-websites-todays-consumer\/\">websites can be responsive <\/a>and mostly are responsive. Depending upon the theme choice and plugins. Plus, some customized settings.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Are Professional Websites Secure?<\/h2>\n<p>In today\u2019s internet world, security is a massive concern. Not just for giant multinational companies, but for companies of all sizes.<\/p>\n<p>Hackers and cyber thieves are always rooting to access sensitive data and crucial information. On average, every 39 seconds, a cyber-attack took place that steals data from unsecured or mildly secured sites.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why big-sized companies pay huge bucks to keep the hackers off.<\/p>\n<p>Without a doubt, every professional website needs to have good web security.<\/p>\n<p>With that, WordPress is secure as long as the developers follow the best practices\u2026 Some plugins and themes are secure; however, not all themes and plugins are secure. That could call for certain security attacks.<\/p>\n<p>Better work with professionals like us who know how to keep your WordPress website secure. Web security is quite technical; it isn\u2019t like you can\u2019t make it secure &#8211; NO! You can &#8211; but it\u2019s highly likely that a few glitches would allow spammers and stealthier to sneak through.<\/p>\n<p>TIP: Keep your website up-to-date that way you minimize the risk of cyber-attack. <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.sucuri.net\/2019\/03\/hacked-website-trend-report-2018.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u201cAs 44% hacking caused by outdated WordPress sites\u201d<\/a><\/p>\n<p>That segue to the importance of relevant content on a website\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>7. Relevant Content<\/h2>\n<p>Crafting relevant content on the topic you\u2019d want to be known for is incredibly important on any website. Especially, if it intends to sell either services or products.<\/p>\n<p>By creating content, you win positions on Google SERPs that land traffic to your blog\/website. The more relevant traffic your website gets, the better your conversion rates are. This works hand in hand with SEO. And to create and publish professional-looking content you need a Content Management System.<\/p>\n<p>WordPress is the world-class Content Management System (CMS). <a href=\"https:\/\/w3techs.com\/technologies\/details\/cm-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WordPress accounts for <strong>61.8%<\/strong> of the market share<\/a>, Followed by Joomla, which sits at <strong>4.7%<\/strong>.

Nothing automatic here, Cringy.<\/li>\n<li>Another downside of it being a most-used CRM, a lot of hackers are always on the lookout to sneak inside and steal your data or damage your website. So, always update the software when they\u2019re due, and keep patching plugins to the latest versions.<\/li>\n<li>If you\u2019re not well versed with plugins and themes better not to implement it yourself. Because it can hugely impact your page load speed. So, it\u2019s a great concern.<\/li>\n<li>Securing a WordPress website can be hazardous if your Programming knowledge is not good.<\/li>\n<li>To fully customize the design to your needs, you need programming knowledge. Sometimes, you want to customize navigations, border sizing, change Typography, and many other things. Without HTML\/CSS\/PHP\/jQuery knowledge, it would cause issues.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Final Words<\/h2>\n<p>In the discussion above, we\u2019ve touched upon several factors that make up whether WordPress is a viable option for professional websites.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, we also touched upon some factors that vouch against WordPress for a professional website.<\/p>\n<p>Also, we saw a few hugely popular brand websites developed on WordPress.<\/p>\n<p>All of the above dissection concludes on the point that WordPress has been the most successful, widely used, and acknowledged platform across all industries.
