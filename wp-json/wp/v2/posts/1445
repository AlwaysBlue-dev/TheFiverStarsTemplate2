The romance between the Fashion and Digital industries has now reached a level of maturity. Brands today are seen setting new benchmarks in social media success. If you are in the business of marketing luxury fashion brands then the content is the new black.<\/p>\n<p>Reports from\u00a0<em>eMarketers<\/em>\u00a0suggest that the fashion industry has seen unprecedented growth in e-commerce activity in recent years with the use of new marketing technology, called digital marketing, generating huge amounts of sales. So what are the types of content that are seen working for this industry?<\/p>\n<p>Reviews are among the top content types that have driven success for the industry. While many of these are user-generated, companies can also use content writers to create articles discussing the value of certain products. Additionally, content that discusses new trends in fashion will provide prospective clients with more information on some items.<\/p>\n<p>Visual content is also a strong tool for businesses in the fashion industry. Prospects want to see how certain items look when included in different styles and look.

Yet, this tends to be exactly where brands screw up most often and therefore the effectiveness of their efforts is lost.<\/p>\n<p>Have you ever wondered why it doesn\u2019t work out? Well, we\u2019ll tell you why. What often happens is that the content created on the website of the brand is highly sales-oriented and does not help, educate or generate interest amongst its audience.<\/p>\n<p>To stay away from this you must ask yourself a few basic questions:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"unorder-class\">\n<li>What on my website will make the customer want to come back?<\/li>\n<li>Is the information that exists on my website, only product oriented?<\/li>\n<li>Do I offer anything to the customer that goes beyond just making an attempt to a sale?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Well, if the answers to these questions are not up to satisfaction, you know it\u2019s time for some change. Because today, with all the options that consumers have it is easier to find a designer or brand that offers something that you do not. Thus, you must create an experience for your customer when they visit your website. You must give them something beyond the product offering.<\/p>\n<p>Content marketing is less pushy than other, more traditional methods. By engaging, educating, and\/or helping your customers, you begin to gain their trust in your brand and make them feel as if you have more to offer them than just a product.<\/p>\n<p>Nowadays, customers have started to expect your brand to have a creative content marketing strategy and if you\u2019re not seen implementing them on your website, potential customers will start going elsewhere.<\/p>\n<h2>Guidelines for success<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"unorder-class\">\n<li>The first thing to keep in mind when deciding on what kind of content to create is that it must make sense for your brand. Anything that feels forced or unnatural will come across in a negative way and work against rather than for you. In Other words, don\u2019t just create but curate matter.<\/li>\n<li>Differentiate yourself with the content you share. Creating exclusive online products to outshine your competition is not it; you also need to generate content for that extra impact. Viral videos, lookbooks, and catwalk streaming are still strong. Celebrity endorsements are also creating an extra buzz online. Provide white background, and clean product images so that when images of your products are shared on other platforms they still look good and attractive. Consumers love to pin images of their favorite clothes or share them on Facebook with their friends.<\/li>\n<li>Collaborate and encourage sharing of your content. Fashion bloggers now have their own community using social search tools, creating their own trends and heavily influencing a customer\u2019s shopping decisions. Also, don\u2019t limit yourself to just Facebook or Twitter but include Pinterest, Instagram, Polyvore, Google+, Youtube, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul class=\"unorder-class\">\n<li>You must spend some time thinking about your customer. What would he\/she like? How does he\/she spend their time? What motivates and excites her? Does he\/she travel, entertain, cook, craft, or DIY? Create content that speaks to these other aspects of his\/her world, beyond his\/her clothing and accessory choices, and he\/ she will identify your brand as the one with real value.<br \/>\nIn the sections to follow we will talk about a few such great examples who speak to the customer about more than just their products.<\/li>\n<li>Lastly, don\u2019t forget to measure your efforts. Things like website traffic, time spent on site, engagement with content (commenting, sharing), and actual sales as a result of this engagement are all important things to note. As you learn what works and what doesn\u2019t and adjust what you\u2019re doing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>A Few Success stories from the Fashion Industry<\/h2>\n<p>The list below will tell us what some of the brands did and how they stood out from the rest. Also, it will throw light on the content marketing method or trend they shine out with and techniques you can follow for your startup brand or one that is already in the market.<\/p>\n<h3><em>Victoria\u2019s Secret<\/em><\/h3>\n<p>Yes, it is a big name and yes, we all already know them, then you might be wondering why to talk about them as an example.

The innovative team has produced a space that, while always focusing on brand, extends past just bags and shoes, to highlight food, music, travel, arts, and culture, etc. Thus even while talking about other topics, they relate back to fashion and their own products, making it all resonate with their own tone of voice. How Brilliant!<\/p>\n<h3><em>Net-A-Porter<\/em><\/h3>\n<p>This online fashion brand takes content production to a new level, almost becoming a publisher first and retailer second. Their website and primary shop front appear like a magazine with lots of articles, features, and celebrity interviews. They then utilize their profoundly subscribed social channels to circulate their content and build a vibrant online conversation with their customers. They also showcase videos guiding clients on health issues, beauty secrets, and even yoga, making them relate to the brand even more.<\/p>\n<p>These brands are well established in terms of Content Creators with budgets to match, but in spite of that, it\u2019s apparent that there\u2019s ample that other businesses, both large and small, can learn from them.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>So put on your thinking hats, get creative, and dig deeper into how you can exploit content to build your brand today. Regardless of the industry, content marketing is all about connecting with your customers and discovering the basis of a conversation with them. Creating and curating content that makes customers return to you over and over again is challenging but building and getting to know your audience using strategies that work best for your brand and developing your voice is the recipe to success.<\/p>\n<p>Like what you see here?
