										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The company profile is a short description of your business. It&#8217;s a way to introduce your company and its products or services to the world, helping people understand what you do and how they can get in touch with you. You can use it as an opportunity to build trust with clients who don&#8217;t know much about you yet, or even as an opportunity for them to learn more about who they&#8217;re buying from.</p>
<p>Company profiles are also good for marketing purposes: by showing off what makes your enterprise unique (or similar), potential clients will be more likely to open up about their needs—and that&#8217;s when sales come in!</p>
<p>A company profile can be written in a number of different ways. You could write it yourself or hire someone to do it for you. The most important thing is that there must be consistency between all of your company profiles so that people know what they are buying when they look at one website or another.</p>
<h2>Benefits of a Company Profile </h2>
<p>Company profile is important for large as well as for small businesses that want to grow fast. It helps you stand out from the competition, attract new customers and build trust with your existing ones. The pursuing are some of the advantages;</p>
<ul>
<li>It serves as a great marketing tool</li>
<li>Helps your company stand out</li>
<li>Builds brand awareness &#038; credibility</li>
<li>Gives a sentiment about your products and services</li>
<li>Helps in the recruitment process</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use a company profile to increase sales by <a href="https://www.digitaltrails.co.uk/10-steps-to-create-and-maintain-a-positive-brand-image/" target="_blank" title="company profile design service" rel="noopener">creating a positive brand image</a> for your business. This will help customers choose products or services from you over competitors because they know that what you sell is good quality or genuine in nature.</p>
<p>You can use the company profile as a marketing tool to attract more customers by displaying information about how much money was spent on advertising campaigns, how many people attended events etc., which shows them how committed these companies are toward their customers’ satisfaction levels (and thus increases chances of making repeat purchases).</p>
<h2>How to Create a Company Profile</h2>
<p>A company profile is a summary of your business. It should be short and concise, clear and easy to understand, and have a good visual design. The information you provide should be up-to-date at all times so that potential customers can see what you are offering right now in the marketplace as well as look forward to future plans.</p>
<p>A company profile should be written in simple English text with no technical terms or jargon. The graphics and images used in the company profile must be top-notch with attention to detail. It should not be overly long as it will not be read by many people including potential customers or clients who might contact you for services or products. </p>
<p>If possible, try to use an even amount of slides, images, and text so that there is sufficient room for other important information such as contact details and website URL address, etc.</p>

<h2>Pros and Cons of a Company Profile </h2>
<p>A company profile is a document that outlines the history of a company and its mission. It&#8217;s often used by potential investors or business partners to get an idea of what a company does and how it works. A company profile can also be used as an example for writing other kinds of documentation, like blog posts, press releases, or marketing collateral.</p>
<h3>Pros </h3>
<p>A company profile is a summary of your company&#8217;s values and goals, as well as its mission. It should be easy to read, but also provide details about what you&#8217;re passionate about as an organization and what makes you special. A good company profile will show that you understand your target audience—which is why it&#8217;s so important for businesses that want to stand out in their field!</p>
<h3>Pros </h3>
<p>Some people may not like the idea of a company profile. It can be hard to keep up with the latest news and developments, especially if you&#8217;re not involved in the industry. The process of creating a company profile can be time-consuming, so if you&#8217;re looking for something quick and easy, this might not be for you. Creating a company profile is expensive—you&#8217;ll need someone who has expertise in writing about businesses or startups (or both) who will charge per hour based on their estimate of how long it takes them to complete each task they are asked to do by your organization(s).</p>
<h2>Is a Company Profile Really Important for a Business? </h2>
<p><strong>The answer is yes</strong>, a company profile is really important for a business.</p>
<p>A company profile can be a tool to tell people about your business, it helps you to build trust with your customers and it helps you stand out from the competition. This will attract more potential clients who are looking for something different than what they have already seen on other websites or social media platforms.</p>
<p>Company profile is really important for small businesses that want to grow fast. It helps potential customers to understand your company and product better, build trust with them, create brand awareness and grow your business.</p>
<p>When having a company profile on LinkedIn, helps people find out more about you so that they can get in touch with you if they have any questions or need assistance with something corresponding to what you do.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We hope this blog has made you understand the importance of a company profile and how to build one. The next step is to start <a href="https://zeracreative.com/company-profile-writing-designing-company-pakistan/" title="company profile design service">designing your company profile</a>, but it’s a good idea to keep these tips in mind while you do so.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AI wonders are making graphic design agencies giddy with excitement and terrifying them at the same time. Its massive transformation into the tech world has shaken numerous industries and the design world is no exception.</p>
<p>Where newbies fear AI to be a substitute, professionals know how to leverage its full capacities. So, if you are wondering how the technology can help transform the design industry and what ways AI can assist an ethical designer, here&#8217;s the blog to find your answers.</p>
<h2>Growth and Application of AI Across Major Industries</h2>
<p>AI has experienced a snowballing adoption rate over the years due to its uncompromising efficiency and advances. According to the <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/3104/artificial-intelligence-ai-worldwide/#dossierKeyfigures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statista report</a>, the global market size reached $327.5 billion in 2021.</p>
<p>Whereas, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-11-22-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-artificial-intelligence-software-market-to-reach-62-billion-in-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner</a> predicted AI software to reach $62 billion in 2022 alone. The global annual revenue of AI software currently is around $50 billion, see below:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4349" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies.png" alt="Future of AI Designs: Guide For Graphic Design Agencies - future of ai designs guide for graphic design agencies - Zera Creative" width="532" height="391" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies.png 532w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies-300x220.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px" title="Future of AI Designs: Guide For Graphic Design Agencies 5"></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.tractica.com/research/artificial-intelligence-market-forecasts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Omdia</a></p>
<p>AI software integrates a business with its uncountable benefits. Reduced operational time, greater business insights, automation, enhanced productivity and reduced human error are some it powers up any business.</p>
<p>At present, tech giants such as Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft are spending billions of dollars on AI products and services. However, considering the potential of Artificial Intelligence, universities are making it a prominent part of their curricula. All the major industries have now untapped the undeniable significance and the role of AI to influence innovation and advancements in terms of productivity, security and efficiency. So, how does AI transform the design industry? Let&#8217;s dive deep below:</p>
<h2>Future of AI Designs: Rising Above the Hype</h2>
<p>To let AI assist graphic design agencies with its full capacity and potential there is a need to first deconstruct it. Instead of thinking about AI as <strong>“artificial intelligence”</strong>– a substitute, consider it as <strong>“augmented intelligence”</strong>. Designers need to conceptualise AI as a tool that augments the level of intelligence in a service in terms of its overall quality or productivity.</p>
<p>AI bots are not replacing designers but instead assisting them in terms of optimization and speed. A designer using AI software tends to create designs faster and with greater proficiency. AI bots have the power to analyze vast amounts of data and offer accurate suggestions to enable a designer to create a most engaging and industry-specific design.</p>
<h3>Speedy Design Prototyping</h3>
<p>With the help of AI tools, designers can create multiple prototype versions that can be A/B tested with users. The tools assist in scanning basic sketches for speedy design prototyping. In the AI tool users enter a few parameters and get a library full of UI components that provide a prototype which is aligned with the company&#8217;s design system. Airbnb is one of those early adopters who are using this technology to generate design components using computer vision-enabled AI and machine learning.</p>
<h3>Seamless Product Localization</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4350" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies-zera-creative.png" alt="Future of AI Designs: Guide For Graphic Design Agencies - future of ai designs guide for graphic design agencies zera creative - Zera Creative" width="670" height="234" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies-zera-creative.png 670w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies-zera-creative-300x105.png 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/future-of-ai-designs-guide-for-graphic-design-agencies-zera-creative-600x210.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" title="Future of AI Designs: Guide For Graphic Design Agencies 6"></p>
<p>AI has introduced game-changing models to integrate personalization in the design industry. Google, Facebook and Netflix have been using AI technology to capture the attention of their users and keep them engrossed in their platforms. Two major problems that every designer has encountered were product localisation and the translation of a design into multiple languages, both of these issues are now fully catered to by AI.</p>
<p>Google’s neural machine translation embedded AI bots allows users instantly translate visual information into another language. Moreover, Netflix is leveraging AI to localization of show banners into different languages along with artwork personalization. With AI bots the localized and personalized graphics are instantly created without there need for designers to spend time on them. All that is needed is a skim through to approve or reject the design if necessary.</p>
<h3>Unique Packaging Designs</h3>
<p>A human mind may seize to restrict its capabilities under a certain condition or situation. For instance, for a designer to create multiple unique copies for the same brand having the same ideology is a bit complicated. However, with the help of AI, a professional can commit millions of unique designs with each having incredibly engaging creativity.</p>
<p>The AI algorithms untapped dozens of distinctive patterns, colours and aesthetics creating seven million unique <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2017/06/01/algorithm-seven-million-different-jars-nutella-packaging-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">packaging designs for Nutella</a>. It accelerated the product sales that were presented with captivating designs printed on the front of each jar in Italy. The technology usurped the traditional role of a graphic designer to spend hours creating unique designs.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4351" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/nutella-ai-packaging.png" alt="Future of AI Designs: Guide For Graphic Design Agencies - nutella ai packaging - Zera Creative" width="412" height="392" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/nutella-ai-packaging.png 412w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/nutella-ai-packaging-300x285.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px" title="Future of AI Designs: Guide For Graphic Design Agencies 7"></p>
<h2>The Need For Graphic Designers To Co-Create With AI</h2>
<p>AI design software enables designers to produce eye-catching designs faster and quicker. The bots refine a product&#8217;s image by successfully comparing it with millions of others. it helps in generating enhanced user engagements.</p>
<p>Moreover, by incorporating a personalized touch into the designs brands can generate an accelerated ROI. AI targets multiple data points to fully comprehend a user&#8217;s journey and enables designers the rich data to create the most targetted designs.</p>
<p>AI using facial recognition is able to determine age, gender, context, location and the current mood of users. With this data, a UX designer can target the audience more efficiently.<br />
According to the research, the use of digital assistance by 2021 would reach 1.8B. Hence, with the use of coupling AI and voice recognition, UX designers are able to create speedier and more efficient designs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, AI enables designers to leverage usability metrics. It processes a large amount of data that results in the creation of high-performing designs for products. Lastly, by co-creating with AI, designers can ponder on how users read and look at data that can help them in paying more attention to important areas to target.</p>
<h3>Key Giveaways</h3>

<h2>1. User Intent</h2>
<p>One of the most talked-about trends is to incorporate user intent in your content marketing strategy. You need to create a holistic approach to integrating the right keyword and content that connects and responds to the user&#8217;s needs. If you ponder on the recent <a href="https://www.investisdigital.com/blog/performance-marketing/googles-new-page-title-update-what-you-should-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google updates</a> of improvising Meta titles and descriptions, you&#8217;ll notice how much the search engine is trying to satisfy and cater to its visitors with accurate search results.</p>
<h2>2. Core Web Vitals Optimization</h2>

Use top SEO tools like <a href="https://ahrefs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ahrefs </a>and Google Keyword Ranking to know which is your best performing keyword to pair it with the second or third best keyword.</p>
<h2>4. Content Quality</h2>
<p><a href="https://zeracreative.com/best-seo-company-in-karachi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEO professionals</a> used to focus more on short-term strategies. However, now Google updates have instructed experts to provide more value to their audience. Content needs to be precise, informative, rich with research, and most importantly valuable. You must not rely on one or two kinds of content instead dive deeper to try innovative techniques to reach out to your audience. For instance, reels a feature on Facebook, can be utilized to interact and connect with your audience.</p>
<h2>5. Use of Structured Data &amp; Rich Snippets</h2>
<p>In the quest to make information accessible and offer accuracy Google introduced <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/strings-to-things-entities-and-seo-mozcon-2013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">semantic SEO techniques</a>.

Many businesses around the world are now leveraging schema markup techniques which make it one of the most followed SEO trends.</p>
<h2>6. Long-Form Content</h2>
<p>Branding eBooks, lengthier blogs, and infographics are some of the leading content techniques that are in the frontline to gain rankings.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4275" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/long-form-content-seo-trends-2022-zera-creative.png" alt="10 Actionable SEO Trends &amp; Strategies to Follow In 2022 - long form content seo trends 2022 zera creative - Zera Creative" width="809" height="472" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/long-form-content-seo-trends-2022-zera-creative.png 809w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/long-form-content-seo-trends-2022-zera-creative-300x175.png 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/long-form-content-seo-trends-2022-zera-creative-768x448.png 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/long-form-content-seo-trends-2022-zera-creative-600x350.png 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/long-form-content-seo-trends-2022-zera-creative-800x467.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 809px) 100vw, 809px" title="10 Actionable SEO Trends &amp; Strategies to Follow In 2022 21"></p>
<p>Wondering why? Well, this is one technique that offers a high level of Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (in short <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2019/08/core-updates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E-A-T</a>) signals that Google stands out for. It provides a credible source of information to the readers and gives them a detailed overview of the service or industry they are interested to explore. Brands are now moving towards incorporating long-form content to generate traffic on their sites and position themselves more firmly on the search engine.</p>
<h2>7. Changes in SERP</h2>
<p>Have you been noticing the significant SERP changes lately? If not, it&#8217;s high time you learn more about it. The latest SERP changes are targeting digital marketing strategies including Google images, PPC, Knowledge Graphs and Apps.</p>
<p>Among the many SERP changes the foremost was the introduction of tabs in the image section. When you type a query to look for an image, Google will automatically offer clearer suggestions in the tabs. Next is the appearance of PPC ads which are now not that easily visible. The third one was the Product Info Graph which gives a detailed overview of products from reviews to specifications. Next was the expansion of meta titles and descriptions to help visitors easily navigate to the results they are looking for on Google.</p>
<h2>8. AI-Generated Content</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence in SEO will continue to create a greater impact through its advanced and redefined techniques. The use of voice search, tools, and semantic SEO techniques will help AI bots to rank a website with greater efficiency. Furthermore, AI-generated content is now taking the center stage. <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI </a>made the GPT-3 (third-generation Generative Pre-trained Transformer) easily available for public use. With that many leading tools like CopyAi, Jarvis, and Headline surfaced. These tools assist in creating different forms of content including titles, descriptions, blogs, reports, and articles. The content stays original, informative, and valuable.</p>
<h2>9. Content Optimization Software</h2>
<p>You need to get your hands on cutting-edge content marketing software. Some of the top-notch tools are SEO surfer, MarketMuse and <a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1537039&amp;u=2786341&amp;m=97231&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SemRush</a>. These tools will not only optimize on the basis of local SEO but will let you create powerful content that can satisfy Google crawlers. You get to monitor your SEO performance and update it as per the latest trends.</p>
<h2>10. The Democratization of Search</h2>
<p>Search is becoming more democratic while designing a web experience for users. Where Domain authority and backlinks were the crucial techniques, search has turned out to be a secret hack to score Google ranking. For websites, mobile-friendliness is the top technique. You have to offer features that can provide ease and accessibility to all the users. With an optimized search option, you intend to offer targeted results to your visitors engaging them to spend more time on your site. If your website provides high quality and seamless experience it&#8217;s more likely to rank at the top.</p>
<h3>Wrap Up</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have to agree with the claim of many web developers and digital marketers that websites have come a long way from web pages that only contained textual information and photos to today’s ones that have much more complex content. Customer expectations are much higher than before, so now the website should inform, entertain, but also offer an intuitive general experience of staying on it, which in simple language means to be easy to navigate.</p>
<p>Everything, from the aesthetics of the site, to the place where the call-to-action will be placed, affects how long the customer will stay on it. <a href="https://zeracreative.com/wordpress-development-company/">How to make a website more user-friendly</a> than it used to be is a topic we are constantly contemplating and below we share with you the conclusions we have reached.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4722 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/infographic-05-scaled.jpg" alt="8 Ways to Make Your Website More User-Friendly - infographic 05 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1920" height="1287" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/infographic-05-scaled.jpg 1611w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/infographic-05-300x201.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/infographic-05-1024x687.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/infographic-05-768x515.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/infographic-05-1536x1030.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/infographic-05-2048x1373.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/infographic-05-960x644.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/infographic-05-600x402.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/infographic-05-954x640.jpg 954w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/infographic-05-800x536.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" title="8 Ways to Make Your Website More User-Friendly 38"></p>
<h2>1. Listen to the Needs of the Users</h2>
<p>Always ask regular visitors/customers of your website on behalf of the brand what they think should be found on the site and how it can be improved. When you receive this type of information, directly from those who are your primary target group, you come to important knowledge and see the content on the site through the eyes of customers, for whom it is intended.</p>
<p>Sometimes these comments are very precise, so with their help, you can better arrange the content and elements on the site. When the user is placed in the center of the process and the design and content of the site are made according to him, he automatically becomes user-friendly.</p>
<h2>2. Increase the Loading Speed</h2>
<p>The expectations of the average customer when he enters a website are such that he wants the content of the site to be loaded as soon as possible, so to speak, at the speed of light. They have these expectations especially when it comes to mobile devices. This means that (when ‘translated’ into statistics) half of them <a href="https://www.theindustry.fashion/gone-in-3-seconds-mobile-shoppers-dont-wait-for-websites-to-load/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expect the site to load in two to three seconds</a> and if that does not happen, they leave it.</p>
<h2>3. Share Accurate and Relevant Information</h2>
<p>In order for customers to make a well-thought-out purchase decision, they need to be familiar with a somewhat broader context and more information than the basic information they come across on, say, social media. If they have to ‘dig’ to learn such information on the site, they will certainly think that the company is hiding something and that the brand is not transparent enough.</p>
<p>Therefore, especially when it comes to the sale of some more complex machines or devices, it is important to explain the benefits of use as simply as possible, but also clearly and comprehensively enough, and so on.</p>
<h2>4. Make Navigation Intuitive</h2>
<p>When a customer comes to a website, he usually seeks the menu first to go in search of what he needs to buy. Therefore, the menu has a very important role in making the site as easy to navigate as possible because, with its help, the customer navigates through the content and finds the product he came for.</p>
<p>When he finishes his purchase or simply wants to come back for another product, there is a “Home” page, which he comes to again by navigating through the menu. However, you should not overdo it with individual tabs in the menu so that it does not become congested, so simplicity and priority selection should be your main technique when creating a navigation menu.</p>
<h2>5. Choose Colors Carefully</h2>
<p>Choose colors for your website carefully for several reasons. First, because a balance between beauty and clarity is needed, and we will clarify what that means immediately. Colors must be relevant to the industry to which the client belongs, and in addition, the contrast between the background and the text must be such as to give the site visitor the ability to quickly and easily read the content.</p>
<p>And did you know that with the help of colors, conversions on the site can be increased? This is another reason to choose and suggest colors carefully.</p>
<h2>6. Improve the Layout of the Site</h2>
<p>It is well known that <a href="https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/mobile-desktop-internet-usage-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 55% of Internet users access sites via smartphones</a>, which they use more and which practically rarely leave their hands. That is why, if an online business wants to record increased sales of products through the site, it is important that its content is visible on all devices from which customers make a purchase (desktops, mobile phones, tablets, etc.).</p>
<p>Are you still wondering after this why it is important to understand responsive web design? We hope not.</p>
<h2>7. Pay Attention to Where You Put the CTA</h2>
<p>It is not enough to write a good copy, but also a clear and impressive CTA (call to action), which will encourage site visitors to buy something, sign up for an e-book, newsletter (whose <a href="https://www.websiteplanet.com/email-marketing-services/benchmark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subscriber’s base can be further enriched and improved</a> using web services such as Benchmark), workshop, etc.</p>
<p>However, when the copywriter does his part, suggests where to put the CTA, one of your web designers enters the scene, with the mission to turn it into an even more striking and attractive one. For that, he will again use the contrast in the choice of background colors and the box/button for the CTA.</p>
<h2>8. Make the Contact Page Accessible and Visible</h2>
<p>Most website visitors who sell a product or service believe that if contact information is not available, the brand should not be considered for further actions on their side. Also, most are not satisfied if they see only a contact form or email on this page, but want as many ways to contact the brand as possible.</p>
<p>So, do your best to enable and add live chat options for your customers, and larger companies definitely need free-of-charge numbers where customers can reach them out. If we are talking about how to add credibility to the site itself and indirectly to the brand, this is a sure way.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is important for every company, no matter what it does, to have a strong Internet presence these days. <a href="https://zeracreative.com/how-a-website-can-take-your-business-to-a-next-level/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When it comes to the success of a website</a>, there is one very simple truth to keep in mind – if you want customers to come to your site and use all its benefits, including online shopping, then that site must be easy to use.</p>
<p>If you want success, and your site is not user-friendly, then you are doing more damage to your business than benefit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It doesn’t matter how thorough and well-researched your content is, if it cannot follow On-Page SEO guidelines, it would never disrupt fierce competition. And, would never see limelight aka cement top places on SERPs.</p>
<p>Heck, not even be read by the target audience as the content pieces would be far away from page 1 … and as a result, your content would keep on piling up dust and nothing else.</p>
<p>That’s why no website can afford to not implement On-Page SEO tactics that pronounce its authority to search engines. So search engines could rank it better than competitors and show it to the mass audience.</p>
<p>This article intends to dispense some highly valuable On-Page SEO strategies that will help better your rankings. The strategies we’re going to show you are quite useful that even <a title="SEO gurus in Pakistan" href="https://zeracreative.com/seo-company-pakistan/">SEO gurus</a> would hoard from you so they can sell their course…</p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s get into the nuts and bolts…</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4743 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-scaled.jpg" alt="Secrets to Nail On-Page SEO (That SEO Gurus Won’t Tell) - infographic 13 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1594" height="1080" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-scaled.jpg 1594w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-300x203.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-1024x694.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-768x520.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-1536x1041.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-2048x1388.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-960x651.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-600x407.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-944x640.jpg 944w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/infographic-13-800x542.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1594px) 100vw, 1594px" title="Secrets to Nail On-Page SEO (That SEO Gurus Won’t Tell) 40"></p>
<h2>Snippet Optimization</h2>
<p>In 2022 snippet optimization is HUGE.</p>
<p>No blog should be without snippet optimization because regardless of your position in Google SERPs … Google shows your content on top of every other content for a particular keyword if it was optimized for that keyword.</p>
<p>What it means, you gain Zero Position on Google SERPs well above any ranked website, if you optimized snippets better than them. Isn’t it fascinating?</p>
<p>There are two ways to do so,</p>
<p><strong>1. Write a helpful answer paragraph that gives a quick solution to the readers.</strong></p>
<p>Since Google values its users, it would pick up on the on-point answer as a standalone so users don’t have to wrap their heads around it to get the answer.</p>
<p>And if users want to go in-depth to understand the base of your answer, they can open the link and read it through. It’s so huge that now every single company that understands Google&#8217;s algorithm and criticality to win Zero Position is now focusing on optimizing snippets that show in the Google search.</p>
<p><strong>2.HTML headings are another way to win snippet competition, provided that the headings are relevant to the search query.</strong></p>
<p>Google picks up on these when a paragraph isn’t enough to answer the search query. Like “7 Methods to perform SEO research” or “How to set up your WordPress website” Logically speaking, it would be impossible for a blog creator to cram everything into a single paragraph.</p>
<p>Also, Google knows that the answer to such questions must be thorough, and step by step like a process. So your content must have relevant HTML Headings to be picked by Google as featured snippets.</p>
<p>However, there is other critical and technical info related to snippet optimization like, when to write an answer so Google can pick it up easily, what should be the length of the answer and where to place it in the text body.</p>
<p>To nail it with perfection, you can <a href="/contact">get back to us and we will hook you up</a>.</p>
<h2>Content Relevance Reigns Supreme</h2>
<p>Gone are the days when bloggers would stuff keywords throughout the content to fake search engines and acquire top most places. Now Google and their AI got advanced enough that they no longer facilitate such shady practices of ranking content.</p>
<p>So to rank the content above competitors, the content must have relevance and solve customer queries. We can’t emphasize enough on this.</p>
<p>Google now has changed a fair fit that it only allows genuine content creators that come up with unique content that ticks with readers to rule the SERPs.</p>
<p>The result of this advancement favours top content creators that cater to the relevance and buckle down those content creators that only produce the rehashed version of what’s already been on the web.</p>
<p>So for you to outrank competitors, it’s fantastically critical to producing genuine content that intends to solve readers’ problems. If you satisfy the reader to the core and make them stick around till the end, Google will pick this up and boost your rankings.</p>
<h2>Internal Linking for SEO Optimization</h2>
<p>Internal linking passes on link juice to all the content it’s linked to. This’s a bit technical but would benefit you a lot. Let’s make it simple for you…</p>
<p>OK! So you have a few content pieces that attract eyeballs for all the good reasons and generate a heck of load lot of traffic. But you figure out that the other content pieces aren’t getting as meaningful results as much as you’d hoped for.</p>
<p>In this case, you can link the already ranked posts to the other low-performed posts. That helps pass on a bit of credibility to low-performing posts. Isn&#8217;t it amazing?</p>
<p>Oh… and should I tell you another heck? When companies create a product page/service page they include links to the top-performing content that redirect to that product page.</p>
<p>Which helps them gain link juice and helps improve its overall ranking. Companies keep generating content around the service/product page for that same matter.</p>
<p>However, the relevance of the surrounding contents determines the performance of the directed page. That is the easiest way to improve rankings of your non-performing content by linking to it from high-performing content.</p>
<h2>Outbound Links for On-Page Optimization</h2>
<p>Outbound links are the links that you plug into your content pieces that direct to the authoritative websites.</p>
<p>Websites that have high <a title="Domain Authority (DA) and high Page Authority (PA)" href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/domain-authority" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Domain Authority (DA) and high Page Authority (PA)</a>. These links are vital for Web crawlers to adjudge your content’s authority.</p>
<p>What it means, when you link to credible resources to back up your claims, Google crawlers will follow it and pass on the signal of authority. By authority means, the content you put on is backed up by authoritative data, which increases the legitimacy of your claims.</p>
<p>So, the websites could be Government owned like. .gov or Institutional owned like PubMed etc. So, in the nerve-wracking and palm-sweating competition, outbound links play their vital role.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, finding websites that improve your authority over time is a daunting process and can eat up your time and energy…<br />
The best plot is to <a href="/contact">let us assist you</a> in doing the whole darn thing.</p>
<h2>White Spacing</h2>
<p>You have read it this far… Why? Because you’ve found the content <em>palatable</em>.</p>
<p>If we cramped the whole darn concept without spacing or putting up headings, and breaking up sentences, you wouldn’t mind shutting down the content before reading a single paragraph, let alone read it this far.</p>
<p>What that says is always make use of white spacing (though don’t overdo that). White spacing isn&#8217;t rocket science, simply break up sentences and paragraphs into one or 2 lines.</p>
<p>So the readers feel at ease reading the content without giving themselves a headache. I got it, but what does it have to do with Page SEO?</p>
<p>Smart question! If your readers bounced off without reading till the end, Google picks up on that and terms your content not worthy to the readers. Consequently, Google will push your content down in the rankings.</p>
<p>So white spacing to give breathers to the readers’ eyes is an extremely useful strategy to boost rankings.</p>
<h2>Optimized Images</h2>
<p>Never make the banal mistake of not optimizing images. The ALT text you write for images is picked up by Google, which further propounds to Google what the content is about. The secret to writing ALT text is to write short, punchy, to the point, yet effective and meaningful text.</p>
<p>Text that gives off the exact meanings that you want to convey through your content. The text could be termed as the sum up the context of what you want to portray through content.</p>
<p>The point is always to make sure to optimize images with text that could help boost rankings.</p>
<h2>URL Optimization</h2>
<p>Make sure that the URL link must not as long as your title. And just focus on conveying the gist of the matter in two to three words. For example, for content heading like “7 methods to perform content audit”, the URL mustn’t be this long.</p>
<p>It should be something like www.yourwebsitename.com/content-audit</p>
<p>It helps in two ways; you make it simple for Google to understand what the content is about in less space. Second, you might want to expand your content to 11 methods or could be 21 methods; so you don’t always change the URL.</p>
<p>Since it probably is linked to other resources, and doing so generates 404 errors. You would want to avoid that as it’s not fruitful for your rankings.</p>
<h2>Wrap Up</h2>
<p>Now you’ve learned masterful tricks on how to perform On-Page SEO and jack up your chances to boost organic rankings.</p>
<p>The next thing you need to do is implement them to the tee. Which is a bit of a tedious process if you haven’t done it before. Plus, it might overwhelm you since you already have too much on your plate to handle.</p>
<p>In which case, you can <a href="https://zeracreative.com/best-seo-company-in-karachi/">reach us out</a> and we’ll be happy to assist. However, if you decide to implement them on your own, make sure to cater to all the above tricks to nail on-page SEO.</p>

<p>1. Positioning Through Visibility</h2>
<p>Business is all about <em>positioning</em>.</p>
<p>If you’re one up in a position to your target audience, you can mint far more dollars and authority over them. Whereas, if you reach them out, you hand over that positioning prowess to them.</p>
<p>We know it’s a bit of a “wrapping head around” concept, but hold tight we will walk you through it… Positioning in terms of SEO means is, when we create content based on customers&#8217; problems, we position ourselves as those who will help them out.</p>
<p>Those who’re solving problems while asking nothing for it at first. This gives you a massive positioning edge, and if you continuously produce content that steers them to your solution.</p>
<p>Voila! You have a secret to their heart and their sacred money… But, hey! This isn’t that easier than you might think.</p>
<p>To really get benefit from a position through SEO, you MUST gain top Google places for most keywords that journey your customers to your offer.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.zerolimitweb.com/organic-vs-ppc-2021-ctr-results-best-practices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">71.33% clicks happen</a> on the first page of Google for any search term.</p>
<p>If you don’t know how to secure top places, you can reach us and we’re happy to <a href="/contact">assist</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Web Traffic Without Banking On Ads</h2>
<p>As we all know that paid ads can take a toll on your budget and squeeze it out, if the targeting wasn’t on point, or the message wasn’t as effective.</p>
<p>There are other crucial tricks of the trades that also need to be considered for running paid campaigns. Relying totally on them is a Nah! Nah! strategy.</p>
<p>And as we touched on earlier, reaching them out by targeting them instead of them reaching you out is a low-position, low-status strategy…<br />
Point is, to generate a stable business where customers could come and knock on your door while you sleep day in and day out &#8212; SEO would be your best bet.</p>
<p>No! We aren’t against paid marketing…</p>
<p>In fact, we are huge proponents of that. But what you need to understand is, Paid ads can help you acquire leads in days, though you can’t always bank on Paid ads due to certain complications and always the risk of losing money.</p>
<p>Plus, here you’re reaching them out, &#8212; remember positioning?</p>
<h2>3. Improves Trustworthiness</h2>
<p>Where their money is involved, there is some sure doubt. Doubt could be related to anything…</p>
<p>Optimizing your content is a wonderful way to subdue any doubts. Let’s understand this concept with a scenario, when your customers want to do business with you, especially if big bucks are involved, they would definitely run a Google search.</p>
<p>To see what you’re up to… This is something you might have done as well… Haven’t you?</p>
<p>When you optimize your website or online business for search engines, your customers will deem you worthy as a lot would pop up when they search.</p>
<p>Also, when they go through the content you’ve created, it further plants a seed in their heads of trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Which would give you a massive positioning edge… Not only will your customers shoot to work with you, but also they’d be willing to pay you the premium.</p>
<h2>4. Can Sell To Customers Using Targeted Keywords</h2>
<p>Did you know <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/87-of-shoppers-now-begin-product-searches-online/530139/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">87% of shoppers</a> find products through online search?</p>
<p>Not 10, 20, or 50… It’s 87%! What it illustrates is if businesses don’t optimize their websites for search engines, they leave an enormous sum of money on the table. What about those who optimize? Well, they’re having a ball… Simple as that.</p>
<p>Here’s your opportunity to craft content around keywords that your audience is searching for so you can nudge your target audience towards a solution. (Whisper* your solution). We can’t emphasize enough on this. Again it boils down to <em>positioning</em>. (Ugh, yet again…)</p>
<p>The more you show up for keywords your target audience is searching for, the better positioning you’ll have that you can leverage to sell them. You can search out what keywords your target market is mostly searching for and create content around it. Isn&#8217;t it awesome? BTW, winning top search engine places in the neck-to-neck online competition is a ferocious task that requires a heck load of work and an understanding of certain strategies.</p>
<p>If you stuck to this, who would focus on scaling the business? Amidst of all this, you can reach us out and we’ll help you <a href="https://zeracreative.com/seo-company-pakistan/">rank your website higher in google search</a>.</p>
<h2>5. SEO for Better User Experience UI</h2>
<p>A website that follows good SEO practices always gives off a better user experience. Let us explain this to you, people consider those two aspects separate, however, they are as interlinked as online business and internet connection.</p>
<p>Without an internet connection, online business is nothing but a mere dream and vice versa. Same as, aesthetics and clear navigations are important both for user experience to flip pages and pace around without much problem and for SEO… Without optimizing website aesthetics and ensuring sleek navigations Google will deduct SEO points. Since navigation tells Google what the content is about, and in which category it lies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/?id=477687" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4223" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/58da17cf.jpg" alt="7 Reasons Why SEO is necessary for Your Online Business - 58da17cf - Zera Creative" width="900" height="90" title="7 Reasons Why SEO is necessary for Your Online Business 44"></a></p>
<p>And aesthetics make it easy for users to stay around for long. The point being SEO and UI go hand in hand. Let’s understand this with another example, take page speed and Mobile friendliness for the matter of discussion… <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/mobile-page-speed-google-rankings-user-experience/234739/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Page speed and mobile friendliness</a> are two important aspects of user experience.</p>
<p>Without a responsive and fast site, a website would always repel users. Since it repels users, it’s bad for SEO. And because of these two reasons Google deems content unworthy and relegates it below competitors. The point is for a good website it must have proper integration of SEO and UI.</p>
<h2>6. Market Knowledge</h2>
<p>SEO helps understand what’s working in the industry. The more you bank on SEO, the more you remain on top of the trends. What it means, to stay competitive in your industry on Google SERPs, you must know what are the latest updates in your industry.</p>
<p>Upon knowing, create content around the hot topics. Because if you don’t your competitors will. And that’s not a good place to be in. Right?</p>
<p><strong>Staying up to date with the trends has two benefits:,</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>You can turn a lot of visitors to your website by leveraging the power of currently in-demand or top-of-the-head topics that your target audience is searching for.<br />
<strong>B: </strong>Based on what’s currently working, you can predict the forthcoming trends and make your strategy regarding it beforehand.</p>
<p>This is the easiest way to hack your way to profits.</p>
<h2>7. Long-Term Strategy That Pays Dividends</h2>
<p>We said it before, and we are saying it again. SEO is not flipping your fingers to get clients&#8217; strategy… It’s a long arduous strategy that initially won’t add much to your bottom line, but 6 months later, or a year later you’d witness some changes.</p>
<p>More inbound leads are coming to fill out the form to work with you or buy your product. Provided that your website is properly optimized on the latest Google guidelines. If it’s, congratulations, you’re about to take off and make huge leaps in your business.</p>
<h2>Wrap Up</h2>
<p>This post enlightens you about the effectiveness of SEO for online businesses. For businesses that intend to flourish and generate organic and inbound leads while they sleep, then there’s no better strategy than doing proper SEO of your website.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4745 size-full" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/infographic-15-scaled.jpg" alt="How to do Keyword Research for SEO (Detailed Guide) - infographic 15 scaled - Zera Creative" width="1920" height="1301" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/infographic-15-scaled.jpg 1594w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/infographic-15-300x203.jpg 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/infographic-15-1024x694.jpg 1024w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/infographic-15-768x520.jpg 768w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/infographic-15-1536x1041.jpg 1536w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/infographic-15-2048x1388.jpg 2048w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/infographic-15-960x651.jpg 960w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/infographic-15-600x407.jpg 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/infographic-15-944x640.jpg 944w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/infographic-15-800x542.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" title="How to do Keyword Research for SEO (Detailed Guide) 49"></p>
<h2>1. Google AutoSuggestion or Google Soup Method</h2>
<p>Over the years several tools have been introduced to help you find most searchable keywords.</p>
<p>But the fact is, none of the tools are as accurate as the mighty <strong>GOOGLE</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes! All such tools give you a ballpark analysis on certain statistics, which are sometimes accurate and other times – well, wayward. So solely relying on them is like living in a man-made paradise.</p>
<p>No! It isn’t like we outright eliminate paid tools; not at all.</p>
<p>The point is, none of the tools are as accurate as GOOGLE itself.</p>
<p>When someone is typing keywords in Google search bar, as they are typing, Google shows them different variations based around keywords to make it easy for users to find the relevant content they are looking after.</p>
<p>Google itself did not whip these related searches, Google has picked them up based on what people are searching the most.<br />
You as a business owner doing your own SEO can look up in Google search and find keywords through Google Soup method or autosuggestion method.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s see an example of it,</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you type in <strong>“Weight loss”</strong>, Google would show you some variations of this keyword.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-3779" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo.png" alt="How to do Keyword Research for SEO" width="500" height="" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo.png 321w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo-300x300.png 300w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 321px) 100vw, 321px" title="How to do Keyword Research for SEO (Detailed Guide) 50"></p>
<p>That means you have more keywords that people are searching at your disposal to create content around.</p>
<p>Wait… Before we discuss our next amazing method, Shouldn’t we dispense another cool hack to further leverage Google auto research?</p>
<p>There you go,</p>
<p>You can find more variations to the primary keyword by typing some question words before the keyword,</p>
<blockquote><p>Such as why, when, how, what, which, etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>This will give you more content ideas to create content around.</p>
<p>Isn’t it exceptional?</p>
<p>I won’t go to the next step until I fill you up with everything you should know about Google autosuggestion.</p>
<p>Here’s another cool method to find question based keywords by peeping into related questions.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-3780" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo-guide.png" alt="How to do Keyword Research for SEO" width="500" height="" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo-guide.png 375w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo-guide-300x274.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" title="How to do Keyword Research for SEO (Detailed Guide) 51"></p>
<p>See, these are most searched questions based around the primary keyword we typed.</p>
<p>Dammit, you now have more keywords at your disposal…</p>
<p>Don’t you think this tactic will give you a plethora of keywords? That you can leverage to make 1 year worth content.</p>
<p>However, sometimes (rarely though) you might feel stalled finding keywords with this method.</p>
<p>No problem! We have other tools in our toolkit to help you out…</p>
<p>BTW, one thing to keep in mind that the process isn’t like snapping fingers, it would take you hours and sometimes days to find <strong>hidden gems</strong> from trenches.</p>
<p>However, we have a <a href="https://zeracreative.com/best-seo-company-in-karachi/"><em><strong>dedicated SEO team</strong></em></a> who can do this for you.</p>
<h2>2. Steal your Competitors Keywords</h2>
<p>Don’t shit at me for saying this.</p>
<p>I’m not coaxing you to steal anything illegal.</p>
<p>Instead, I’m telling you to be a street smart cookie to shorten your learning curve.</p>
<p>Having said that, competitive analysis is the surefire way to hack what’s working in the industry.</p>
<p>Your competitors had wrapped their brains around and gone through a rigorous and dreadful process to find highly relevant keywords that solve readers’ problems</p>
<p>What if you played smart enough and discerned the reasons behind what’s currently working for your competitors?</p>
<p>That would set the stage for you to optimize content to not only attract relevant audience but also outsmart competitors by further embellishing content.</p>
<p>This process saves your time and energy and confers you keywords that can make you money.</p>
<p><strong>Here are 2 Free ways you can use to perform Competitive Analysis</strong></p>
<h3>1. Moz Keyword Explorer</h3>
<p><a href="https://moz.com/explorer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moz’s free tool</a> gives you the luxury to peep into competitors&#8217; keywords by typing in competitors&#8217; root domain in the search bar and smack search option.</p>
<p>The result will pop up that gives you a list of 50 top ranking pages of your competitor&#8217;s website with statistics on search volume, keyword difficulty and more.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that a free account only caters to 10 entries per/month. To have more, you need to upgrade the account.</p>
<h3>2. Uber Suggest By Neil Patel</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tool </a>precisely helps you if you want to know the country wise traffic sources, keyword difficulty, and estimated volume for every word.</p>
<p>The country specific data is especially useful when your target audience belongs to a particular area you want to target.<br />
Like Moz’s explorer this tool only provides you a certain number of keywords for free.</p>
<p>What if I gave you the 3rd way of doing competitive analysis?</p>
<p>Here you have…</p>
<p><strong>Through Google Search</strong></p>
<p>Ohh!!! Again Google…?</p>
<p>Well, you can’t keep master at bay, can you?</p>
<p>You can simply type in competitors’ domain in Google search bar, like this</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-3781" src="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo-example.png" alt="How to do Keyword Research for SEO" width="668" height="725" srcset="https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo-example.png 668w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo-example-276x300.png 276w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo-example-600x651.png 600w, https://zeracreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-do-keyword-research-for-seo-example-590x640.png 590w" sizes="(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px" title="How to do Keyword Research for SEO (Detailed Guide) 52"></p>
<p>You see, the results that come against the search that has <strong>“paleo diet”</strong> as keywords.</p>
<p>So you can simply plug in competitors&#8217; domains with any keyword to know whether they optimize the keyword.</p>
<h3>3. Google Trends for Keyword Research</h3>
<p>We apologize for bringing Google again in our conversation.</p>
<p>We can’t just help myself not to include Google in this topic</p>
<p>Anyway, Google trends tell you what’s trending related to your topic.</p>
<p>This gives you an opportunity to jump in and produce content around what’s currently hot in your market.</p>
<p>You can find trending topics by typing abroad keyword.</p>
<p>These insights allow you to jump on any hot topic that could bring an influx of traffic to your website for all the good reasons.</p>
<p><strong>A caveat:</strong> Don’t get tricked into creating content around hot topics that don’t fit into your strategy…</p>
<p><strong>By the way, if you have any issue with forming an <a href="https://zeracreative.com/best-seo-company-in-karachi/"><strong>SEO strategy</strong></a> that aligns with your business goals; we’re <a href="https://zeracreative.com/contact/">here to help</a> you out.</strong></p>
<h3>4. Reddit, Quora, and Niche Forums</h3>
<p>Do you know which is an online goldmine for research?</p>
<p>Yup! You guessed it right…</p>
<blockquote><p>Reddit, Quora and all industry specific forums</p></blockquote>
<p>Where else could you find people writing out their concerns and issues?</p>
<p>Because of the like-mindedness, people post questions about their problems with no hesitation or second thought, and members of the community sincerely try to solve their issues to the best of their abilities.</p>
<p>Here’s your chance to find out what most people are asking, or what bugs them the most?</p>
<p>This gives a sneak into their problem, which you can solve through your content.</p>
<p>Does that WOW you?</p>
<p>I guess so. The last method of doing keyword research isn’t much different either.</p>
<h3>5. Leverage social media for Keyword Research</h3>
<p>Social media is a place to have fun, but ONLY for common people.</p>
<p>Not harried business professionals like you.</p>
<p>Like Forums, <a href="https://zeracreative.com/12-ways-to-leverage-social-media-and-build-blog-audience/">social media</a> can be a potent way to find relevant keywords straight from the audience’s mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Well, there’re gazillion ways to do that…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can leverage the power of <strong>#Hashtags</strong> on <strong>instagram </strong>and <strong>Twitter </strong>to find keywords.</li>
<li>Follow professionals for <strong>linkedin </strong>to analyze topics they are discussing fervently.</li>
<li>Be on Niche Specific <strong>Fb groups</strong> with activity. You will get to see people blabbing about their problems.</li>
<li><strong>Youtube Trending</strong> content to figure out the ongoing trends</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wrap Up</h2>
<p>There you have it… I’m pretty sure that based on these unique and proven methods you’d be able to find niche specific keywords and create mouthwatering and jaw dropping content around.</p>
<p>However, these methods can be time taking.</p>
<p>It might take hours and days to keep the search going before you could find keywords and topics to create content around.</p>
<p>And as a professional, you may not have time for all this.</p>
<p>This’s where we step in to find high traffic, less competitive and lead pulling keywords to capitalize on.</p>
